<p dir="ltr"><strong>Why authenticate with Twitter?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Little Bird asks you log in with your Twitter account so you have one less password to remember and to make it easier to connect Little Bird results to your social networks.</p>
<p><strong>We never Tweet for you</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Connecting your Twitter account to Little Bird has no effect on your account: We never take any actions on Twitter on your behalf unless you yourself initiate them (there are no sneaky checkboxes to uncheck or anything like that, either).</p>
<p><strong>Why does Little Bird need so many Twitter privileges?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Because Little Bird enables you to export results to Twitter lists, we are required (by Twitter) to ask for privileges with your account that include access to other things that we use, simply because Twitter bundles these privileges together.</p>
<p>You can revoke Little Birdâ€™s access to your Twitter account at any time by visiting <a href="https://twitter.com/settings/applications">Settings &gt; Apps</a> for your Twitter account.</p>
