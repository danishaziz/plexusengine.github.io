<p>Little Bird business and enterprise subscribers can export Little Bird report data in a number of useful ways that can help you and your clients learn from, connect with, and build stature among insiders in topical communities.</p>
<h3>Create a Twitter List</h3>
<p>This is a great way to read posts in a topic community and increase your engagement by following, retweeting, and conversing with topic insiders.</p>
<p>Creating a <a title="Twitter Help" href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-how-to-use-twitter-lists" target="_blank">Twitter list</a> via Little Bird will export topic insiders in a Little Bird report to a native Twitter list you can use in your other favorite Twitter tools. Twitter list exports can also be filtered by various Little Bird metrics (eg, make a Twitter list including only the top 50 insiders in a report).</p>
<h3>Spreadsheet File</h3>
<p>This is a great way to further analyze the rich data that Little Bird provides, and/or import Little Bird results into other tools for further use.</p>
<p>All Little Bird report data can be exported as CSV/Excel files, which can then be used in your favorite spreadsheet program. Spreadsheet exports can also be filtered by various Little Bird metrics (eg, export a spreadsheet with only the emergent topic insiders in a report).</p>
<h3>Blog Bundle</h3>
<p>Staying current with the latest blog posts from topic insiders is a great way to increase your understanding of a field, get early notice of significant news, better understand what issues engage topic insiders, and identify appropriate, successful blogs for your engagement with comments, republishing, guest/cross-posting, and advertisement.</p>
<p>Export the feeds of all the blogs discovered in a Little Bird report. You can then import this bundle (in OPML format) into your favorite feed/news reader.</p>
