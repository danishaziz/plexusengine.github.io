<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Little Bird's Shared capability, is temporarily offline while we make it work better. We expect to have a new version that delivers better results available soon.</strong></span></p>
<p>When available, the Little Bird Shared capability provides a visual, magazine format reader that enables you to explore a high-quality stream of online content shared by topic insiders to support your own research and engagement.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we recommend using a couple of other Little Bird capabilities to browse content from topic insiders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Hot News" href="http://getlittlebird.com/tour/faq/tools/hot-news/">Hot News</a></strong>: View the top 5 most popular links posted by leading topic insiders for the day and the week.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Blogs" href="http://getlittlebird.com/tour/faq/tools/blogs/">Blogs</a></strong>: Browse blogs and websites from leading topic insiders.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Search" href="http://getlittlebird.com/tour/faq/tools/search/">Search</a></strong>: Search content in blogs and websites from leading topic insiders.</li>
<li><strong><a title="Export" href="http://getlittlebird.com/tour/faq/tools/export/">Export</a></strong>: Little Bird Business subscribers can export report results in a couple of different ways to browse and search content:
<ul>
<li>Twitter list: Export topical insiders to a Twitter list and browse/search posts from list members in your favorite Twitter client.</li>
<li>Blog bundle: Export topical insider blog/website feeds in blog bundle (ie, OPML) format that can be imported into your favorite feed reader for browsing and searching.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
