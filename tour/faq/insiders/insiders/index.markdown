<p>Little Bird "Insiders" are the most connected people within a larger group found for a topic.</p>
<p>How are Little Bird Insiders found? We spider out across connections from the Seeds in your topic query to build an index of Insiders, then we see which Insiders are most followed by others in the index. Top Influencers are the Insiders followed by the most other Insiders. Little Bird doesnâ€™t pick the leaders, they are picked by their peers in a topic community!</p>
<p>What are Emergent insiders? Little Bird uses some math to calculate how long someone has been on Twitter in relation to their Insider Score, with the goal of discovering insiders who have been in a community for a short time, but have already gained traction with other insiders. Emergent insiders are like "rising stars" that may be open to engagement as they increase their stature in a community.</p>
<p>What are Listening Insiders? Listening insiders are ranked by who is following the most other insiders. In other words: who in a community has their ear most "to the ground", listening to other experts and influencers.</p>
