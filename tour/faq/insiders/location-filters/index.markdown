<p>All Little Bird reports let you browse topical communities by location, using our Locations map to view lists of insiders we have identified in specific areas.</p>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LocationsOpera.png"><img src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LocationsOpera.png" alt="Opera Insiders Map" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1217" /></a></p>
<h3>Location Filtering</h3>
<p>In Beta: Some Little Bird subscription plans also enable you to use a new capability we are beta testing to limit a report to focus on only one location. Use this feature to discover a greater number of insiders in a specific location.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are looking to discover and engage people and organizations in a topical community within a specific geographic area, like a city, state, province, country, region, or continent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theater in New York City</li>
<li>Tech in Oregon</li>
<li>Falconry in the UK</li>
<li>AdTech in Japan</li>
<li>Innovation in Europe</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Little Bird's location filter (now in Beta for select customers) to create reports to identify influencers, their connections and content from a specific location.</p>
<p>When you use our location filter, Little Bird finds a broad, global community of topical insiders and then delivers just those that are based in the geographic area of your choice.</p>
<h3>Location-filtered report creation is easy!</h3>
<ol>
<li>Enter a <strong>topic</strong> for the community of influencers you are looking to identify.</li>
<li>Enter a <strong>location</strong>—making sure you chose the right location from the choices we suggest.</li>
<li>Approve <strong>examples</strong> to run your report. We recommend accepting our default suggested examples even if they don't match your topic or location perfectly. Little Bird needs to cast a wide net to find topical insiders in the specific location you provide.</li>
</ol>
<h3>We might look more widely to find better results</h3>
<p>If Little Bird is unable to discover 10 or more people or organizations related to your topic in the location you provide, we will look in a wider area to return more useful results. For example: if you are looking for innovation influencers in Amsterdam, we may identify less than 10 in that city and might move to look at the Netherlands, or on to Europe as a whole.</p>
