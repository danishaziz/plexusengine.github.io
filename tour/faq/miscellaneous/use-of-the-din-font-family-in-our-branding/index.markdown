<p>Little Bird chose the DIN font face for our visual identity primarily to make sure it was easily legible for our team of robot librarians, who are often required to read communications from our engines on the fly, in low light, as they move at speed around the global Interwebs, pursuing quality information for our customers. Little Bird identifies with the DIN font family's 100-year+ history supporting frank, straightforward human communication.</p>
