<p><em>Find out how connected you -or other people- are to the top insiders in any field online.</em></p>
<h3>Step 1: Enter a Twitter username to compare</h3>
<p>To get started: Navigate to a report and use our <em><strong>Discover Connections</strong></em> capability to highlight if you are (or are NOT) connected to the top online influencers in that field. Simply enter your own or any other Twitter username (e.g. @getlittlebird) and click the <em><strong>Discover</strong></em> button.</p>
<h3>Step 2: See comparison results</h3>
<p>In a short time you will see the Twitter user you entered compared with topic insiders from the Little Bird report. Results include which topic insiders are already following that Twitter user, which topic insiders that Twitter user is already following, and which topic insiders follow that Twitter user and are not followed back.</p>
<p><strong>HOT TIP</strong>: We call this last feature <strong><em>Missed Opportunities</em></strong>, and it's a great first step to begin connecting with insiders who already show an interest in connecting with you.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Engage!</h3>
<p>Use these results to explore and engage with topic insiders to build influence in any conversation. At Little Bird we believe that the best way for someone to build real influence in social networks—just like in face-to-face encounters—is to build authentic relationships by adding value in authentic conversations. Little Bird helps you find out who the most connected people are on any topic, then it's your job to engage effectively with those people.</p>
