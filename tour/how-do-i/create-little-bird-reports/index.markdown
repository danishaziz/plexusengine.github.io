<p><em>You can create a Little Bird report on any topic where you are looking for experts, influencers and high-quality content. The best way to engage in any field is to know where to look!</em></p>
<p>To get started: Choose <em><strong>Create Report</strong></em> from Little Bird’s top toolbar</p>
<h3>Step 1: What community are you interested in?</h3>
<p>To run your first Little Bird report, you can experiment with different topic words or phrases and, if you want, limit your report by location. Topics that will return good results generally are neither too broad (eg, Life) nor too specific (eg, 1978 Toyota Corolla).  Interested in neuroscience? CRM? Italian food? Those are examples of searches that will bring back good results.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Seed your search</h3>
<p>Little Bird will suggest some initial people to seed a full search. You can discard suggested seeds that don’t fit, and/or add your own seed suggestions if you want. We'll use these initial seed Twitter accounts as the basis of our exploration. We're not looking for people who use your query keyword in their content, instead we're looking for experts in Photography like @lensexpert, @photojack and @instagram. We'll see who those people are following, who's following them back and build a big index of that community, automatically.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Run report</h3>
<p>Once you run a report on a topic with seeds, Little Bird will email you in just a few minutes with a link to your detailed report, detailing (up to) approximately 1000 of the most highly-connected people in that topic area, and giving you tools to explore high-quality content from a wide range of topic insiders. Then, you can see all the people and their best content!</p>
