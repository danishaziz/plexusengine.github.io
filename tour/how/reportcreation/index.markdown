<h3>A. How to Create a Report</h3>
<p>To create a report, you’ll want to navigate to the report-creation page. There are two (2) steps involved with creating a topical report on Little Bird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1: Select a Topic</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Choose a Topic</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Little Bird will hand-pick 5 topics we think you’ll like, based on your online connections.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">-OR-</p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Make Your Own</p>
<p dir="ltr">Choose your own topical term that is relevant to the community you’re interested in discovering. To get the best results, this term should be very ‘human’ - i.e. a term that people within that topical community are actively using to describe themselves and their interests. To learn more about term-selection, see the Report Creation section of this Flight Guide, titled, “The Little Bird Search Engine.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen_Shot_2014-02-21_at_12.45.48_PM.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1994" alt="Screen_Shot_2014-02-21_at_12.45.48_PM" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen_Shot_2014-02-21_at_12.45.48_PM.jpeg" width="698" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Optional: Location Filter</span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
<p dir="ltr">The location filter is currently available only to select enterprise partners. This filter will give you the ability to narrow your topical search to a specific geographical location or region. If you begin typing in a location, we’ll suggest matches for you (e.g. is it Portland, Maine you’re looking for, or Portland, Oregon?) If you’re an Enterprise-level subscriber and have access to this feature, please reach out to us with any questions you may have, at <a href="mailto:help@getlittlebird.com">help@getlittlebird.com</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>NOTE: All subscription levels have access to the Location Maps tool in every report. That tool will show you where all of your Insiders are located around the world!</em></p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen_Shot_2014-02-17_at_5.00.03_PM.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1993" alt="Screen_Shot_2014-02-17_at_5.00.03_PM" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen_Shot_2014-02-17_at_5.00.03_PM.jpeg" width="672" height="472" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2: Examples</span></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"></h4>
<p dir="ltr">Step 2 involves choosing appropriate Twitter users as examples of types of people you’re looking for. Little Bird automatically suggests four (4) examples at a time. You can keep them if they fit, or ‘X’ them out if they don’t. You can use the ‘+’ to add new suggested examples after you’ve deleted one or several. During this step, you’ll also have the chance to add your own examples.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>NOTE: Don’t get too worked up about making sure you have the perfect examples (or even a bunch of examples). One quality example will suffice (either suggested by us, or hand-picked by you) and will give Little Bird a starting place for your topical report!</em></p>

<h3>B. The Little Bird Search Engine</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Little Bird search engine is unique unto itself. Quite unlike search engines we’ve become accustomed to (e.g. Google and Ask.com), Little Bird formulates its searches using a proprietary algorithm that does not enlist boolean-type, or multiple-term-linking searches. To optimize the results of your reports, you’ll need to select search terms relevant to the human-communities you’re looking to connect with. Little Bird finds people first, and content second--so you’ll want to formulate your terms to reflect the language that real people are using to describe themselves and the communities they interact in. We’ve experienced great results time and again, by using these types of searches:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Roles</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Industry Sectors</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Activities</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Umbrella Brands &amp; Products</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Product Categories</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Memes</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Acronyms / Abbreviations</strong></p>
<p>It’s useful to try your searches using a variety of ‘types’ and terms. Say for example, you want to discover online communities around the topic of Food. Depending on what aspect of food -- and what kind of Insiders you’re looking for -- you may want to search terms like: Food, Cooking, Chefs, Restaurants, Grocery Stores, Farmer’s Markets, Nutrition, Whole Foods, Steak, Easy Meals, Local Produce, etc.</p>
