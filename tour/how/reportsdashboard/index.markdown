<p dir="ltr">Your reports dashboard is the place that you’ll find all of the reports you’ve created. Until you create reports of your own, both 'My Reports' and 'Our Reports' will appear empty. Once you've initiated one or more reports, you'll see them appear. When a report title shows up in grey, it's still processing. When it turns red, it's complete.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a number of ways to interact with your dashboard, to help you locate your reports quickly and easily.</p>
