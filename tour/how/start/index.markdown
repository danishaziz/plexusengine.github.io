<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A. Request Access</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">You can request access to Little Bird by navigating to the homepage of our website (<a title="getlittlebird.com" href="www.getlittlebird.com" target="_blank">getlittlebird.com</a>) and filling out the access request form, found on the right-hand side of the window. We’re inviting people to Little Bird at a measured pace to ensure the best user-experience possible, and you should expect to receive access within 24-48 hours of your submission.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Claim Account / Log-in</span></h3>
<p>To claim your account, you’ll need to follow the personalized link from within your invitation email. From there, you’ll be asked to agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Upon agreement, you’ll be brought to the Twitter authorization page where you’ll be asked to log into Little Bird using the Twitter credentials of your choice (As a best practice we suggest using your personal Twitter handle on most accounts, as a starting place.)</p>
<p>Once you’ve entered your information, select ‘Authorize App.’ You’ll then be redirected to Little Bird.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Account Settings</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">Once you log into Little Bird for the first time, you’ll be prompted to review your account information and email settings. You can adjust these settings at that point in time if you wish. You can also change them later on by hovering over your name in the upper right-hand corner of the Little Bird window, and selecting ‘Settings.’</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D. Start Trial </span></h3>
<p>After you claim your account, you’ll need to start your free 7-day trial in order to start creating your own topical reports. To do so, simply navigate to the upper right hand corner of the Little Bird window and select the orange ‘Start Free Trial’ button. You’ll get a confirmation message asking if you’re sure you want to start your trial. As soon as you say yes, a countdown will begin, detailing the number of days left in your trial.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">F. Manage Your Organization</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">To Manage your organization, hover over your name in the upper right hand corner and select, ‘Organizations.’ If you’re an Individual-level subscriber, you’ll want to follow this route in order to access your Subscription settings.

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="line-height: 13px;">Manage Users &amp; Reports</span></span></h4>
<p dir="ltr">For business-level subscriptions, there is an allotted number of seats (users) for each account (organization). As such, there will be a dedicated Administrator for each organization. There can be more than one Admin per organization. Admins have the ability to invite other users to their organization and manage their permissions accordingly. Admins also have the ability to change billing information, and subscription settings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the drop-down menu in the upper right-hand corner of the Little Bird window, select Organizations. Then, select Manage Organization. From this view, you’ll be able to see all of the users within your organization, including all of the reports that have been created by yourself and other users. Admins have the ability to remove users from the organization, as well as the ability to delete reports that have been created by any user within that organization. On this page, Admins can also invite other users, simply by entering their first and last name, email address, and permission-level into the invitation form on the page.</p>

<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manage Subscription</span></h4>
<p>By selecting the red ‘Manage Subscription’ link, you’ll be brought to a page that displays your current subscription level and payment information. You can change the credit card you use to pay for your subscription, upgrade / downgrade or cancel your subscription, and view your billing settings.
