<strong>Print-friendly version:</strong> <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Customer-Story-Iron-Mountain-V.1.pdf">Customer Story Iron Mountain v1.0</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">When digital records management company Iron Mountain wanted to ramp up its content marketing to existing and new markets, it turned to Little Bird to find opportunities and inspiration.</p>
<p>The team's previous efforts to discover social marketing opportunities in relevant verticals felt laborious, inexact and less scalable than they needed to be. Early success with Little Bird in content marketing is leading to adoption in multiple parts of the organization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Karen Guglielmo, Content Marketing Manager at Iron Mountain, helps her team use Little Bird to find people online to read and engage with in their target markets. It was when she used the platform herself to start engaging online that she started stacking up the kinds of wins that really excited her coworkers.</p>

When my comments started getting traction, that really got people excited." — Karen Guglielmo, Content Marketing Manager</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Karen took specific examples of conversations she engaged in with target market thought leaders that got traction, showing her team which influencers replied and re­shared her comments and then counting up the new aggregate audience she was exposed to as a result of those conversations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"When I was able to show how Little Bird pointed me to a thread I could comment on and the resulting pass­-along put me in front of 80,000 potential readers ­with just a few minutes of thought required to compose what I wrote—that got people really excited about Little Bird."</p>
