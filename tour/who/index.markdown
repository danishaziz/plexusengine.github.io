<h3>Who are you? (who who, who who...we really want to know)</h3>
<p><strong>Our most successful customers come from the school of thought that authentic engagement - online, just like in "real life" - is what makes for good Social Media Marketing (SMM). We believe that in order to build influence online and use the power of Little Bird effectively, it takes time and real engagement. (link to Why)</strong></p>
<p>The work is never over, which some may see as bad news. We believe this presents an ongoing opportunity to continuously share your insight, knowledge and brand stories with others while you are concurrently positioned to learn from the top insiders in any field.</p>
<p>Finding your Brand's true core and telling your brand story is an ongoing endeavor, and one that requires commitment. The hard part in getting started and maintaining momentum often includes identifying who to begin to connect with - just like in "real life."</p>
<p>Our most successful customers understand that their marketing plans are ever-evolving, whether in TV, print, or online. Little Bird is here to help begin and maintain your conversations online with the most influential insiders on any topic and easy, actionable ways to start your engagement.</p>
<p>From Enterprise level implementation to solo entrepreneurs, we've got you covered. Let us help you!</p>
