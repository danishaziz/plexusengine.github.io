<p><code></code>Influencer marketing can help spread the word about your brand and expose your content to a much broader audience. But b<b>r</b>and advocacy is only the tip of the iceberg. There's much deeper value just below the surface.</p>
<h3><strong>Full-Circle Influencer Marketing: Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg</strong></h3>
<p>Identifying and reaching influencers is important, but it's just one small part of the deeper value that a strategic approach can deliver, with the ultimate goal of earned advocacy. Much like earned media, <a title="Little Bird Home Page" href="http://getlittlebird.com" target="_blank">Little Bird</a> CEO Marshall Kirkpatrick says earned advocacy is the the most valuable (and, possibly, elusive) outcome of influencer marketing. But there are pitfalls.</p>
<p>In his talk at Hubspot's INBOUND conference last week, Marshall shared his perspective on how to avoid those pitfalls—think cold, irrelevant pitches—and successfully engage with influencers.</p>

<p>When done right, advocacy creates a <a title="Virtuous circle definition" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle" target="_blank">virtuous circle</a> that builds social capital and pays ongoing dividends for your business. But this circle runs counter-clockwise, and it doesn't start with pitching influencers.</p>
<h4><b style="line-height: 1.5em;">Step 1. Listen to the smartest people in your field</b></h4>
<div>Start by doing a little research. Gather market intelligence through the eyes of others. "Ask an influential person to talk about you and you'll be happy for a day," Marshall says. "Learn to listen to the best and you'll capture business value all year long."</div>
<div></div>
<h4></h4>
<h4><b>Step 2. Create, curate and share the best content</b></h4>
<p>Dig deeper on what others have to offer. For example, read what your customers, prospects and thought leaders in your field are reading. Contribute to the conversation.</p>
<h4><b>Step 3. Build relationships that lead to earned advocacy</b></h4>
<p>Finally, be genuinely curious, purposeful and generous as you build relationships. For example, when I recently met Pam Didner, an influential expert in global content marketing, the very first thing she said was, "How can I help you?" Now that's a great way to start a conversation!</p>
<p>For too many marketers, influencer marketing or advocacy begins and ends with finding the most popular influencers and hitting them up for a favor. As Lee Odden, CEO of TopRank Online Marketing, recently said, "The day to start recruiting influencers is not on the day you need them."</p>
