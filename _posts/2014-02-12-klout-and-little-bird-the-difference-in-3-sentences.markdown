  content: "[...] Disclosure: I am the CEO of Little Bird, which is a more effective,
    interesting and genuine social business technology than Klout. That said, I use
    Klout every day, they paved the way for our customers to start thinking about
    us and I wish them nothing but the best in their new hard-earned home. The following
    post is filled with metaphor, followed by quick thoughts on owned, earned and
    paid media. Here&#8217;s a more plain spoken one on our company blog: Klout and
    Little Bird, the difference in 3 sentences. [...]"

  content: "The vision expressed here is remarkable and shows a savviness about online
    influence that can only come from actual influencers.  In that sense, this product
    is already poised to be a success.  \n\n\nThat said, I look forward to seeing
    the Little Bird vision become more actionable for users -- it's great that there's
    so much progress being made on the data side, but there are huge opportunities
    for UI/UX improvement.  The data appears to be pretty solid so far, which is why
    I find the sales pitch credible.\n\n\nKeep grinding, guys!  You understand context
    in a way that your competitors do not.  And that's very exciting."

    Great job Marshall, Nate and the rest of the LB team.

    Every detail of the app is well-though-out. This makes for a terrific experience, as the app succeeds in doing the work for the user (and not the other way around). Rock on!

<p>Klout, the biggest name in influencer metrics, is <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/140211/p24#a140211p24">reportedly being acquired</a> by corporate social network vendor <a href="https://www.lithium.com/">Lithium Technologies</a>. We're often asked about the difference between Klout and <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>, and we expect to be asked even more in the coming weeks. Here it is in three sentences.</p>
<p><em>Bonus: Coming soon...the Little Bird API. More data, better data and more actionable information, inside your application.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/futw.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-1916" style="margin: 10px; float: right;" alt="" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/futw.png" width="200" height="272" /></a><strong>1. Influence in Context</strong><br />
Little Bird's metric of influence isn't about popularity with the public at large like Klout's; we measure influence among people and organizations who are relevant to a particular topic or industry.</p>
<p><strong>2. Actionable Information</strong><br />
Little Bird makes it easy to engage with the people it discovers, by analyzing your existing and potential connections and by delivering the hottest conversations for you to engage with influencers and their knowledge. Klout tells you who is influential and then leaves you to your own devices to take action—at best helping you send them "perks" or free stuff to try to win them over as advocates. We believe meaningful advocacy is one byproduct of effective, authentic engagement—not something you can buy. (Sorry for two extra sentences in this one.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Discovery for Business Utility</strong><br />
Klout's keyword-based discovery of topics and new people returns limited and noisy information; at Little Bird we specialize in analyzing the connections between people in order to discover who influences the influencers, on almost any topic, on demand—delivering information that drives real results for business in marketing and sales.<br />
We've got great data and great tools for leveraging it. We hope you'll <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">sign up to request access</a> and try Little Bird out for yourself.</p>
