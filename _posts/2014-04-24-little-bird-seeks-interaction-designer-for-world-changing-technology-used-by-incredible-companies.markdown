<p dir="ltr"><strong>As an <em>Interaction Designer</em>, you:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">- have a solid understanding of what a functional relationship between people and product entails, and the psychology behind those relationships (especially in a digital, social space)</p>
<p dir="ltr">- are able to look objectively at the behavior of a product with a critical technical eye, as well as with a non-technical human user perspective</p>
<p dir="ltr">- have a unique propensity for efficient and effective research (internally and externally) to determine what’s working and what isn’t, and maintain the ability to solve for needs that aren’t being met</p>
<p dir="ltr">- are unafraid to present your solutions to a room full of people, and come prepared with analysis and evidence to back them up</p>
<p dir="ltr">- have a strong sense of empathy–you truly seek to understand what the customer feels, and how you can improve the product to improve their experience</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>As a <em>Visual Designer</em>, you:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">- know how to create balance in the look, feel, and functionality both technically, and on a more subtle sensory level</p>

<p dir="ltr">- have a solid understanding of graphic design (you hold a degree in graphic design, or have equivalent field experience)</p>
<p dir="ltr">- have significant experience using a wide variety of web design and graphic design tools, and understand how to design for cross-platform functionality and responsiveness (desktop, mobile, tablet, etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>As a <em>User Interface / Front-end Developer</em>, you:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">- you have a solid working knowledge of and experience writing HTML, Javascript, &amp; CSS (bonus points if you know Ruby, Sinatra, LESS, and Bootstrap)</p>
<p dir="ltr">- you understand what user-centered design really means, and how to structure a product accordingly</p>
<p dir="ltr">- know how to build a product that’s adaptable to scaling and flexible with evolving needs</p>
<p dir="ltr">- have an efficiency mentality, and have an effective approach for resolving clutter and excess</p>
<p dir="ltr">- are innovative and forward-thinking in your approach to development, optimization, and market demand</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Additionally, you must:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">- be comfortable working in a team environment and being held accountable for your responsibilities</p>
<p dir="ltr">- communicate clearly and effectively with solid interpersonal skills, cross-departmentally</p>

<p dir="ltr">- have a self-starter attitude</p>
<p dir="ltr">- truly enjoy the process of building, iterating, and refining (and it shows in your demeanor)</p>
<p dir="ltr">- have an interest in being part of a growing technology startup</p>
<p dir="ltr">- have a real focus on consistently growing and learning, both personally and professionally</p>
