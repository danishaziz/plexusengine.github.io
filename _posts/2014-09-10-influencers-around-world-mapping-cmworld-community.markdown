<p>This week we're at Content Marketing World in Cleveland, Ohio, meeting with people and companies from around the world who are investing in content as a way to grow their brands.  Where do they come from? Everywhere.</p>
<p>We used <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird's</a> social graph technology to discover the most-connected people online, from around the world, in the Content Marketing World Community.  You can take a look at that data and see what a Little Bird report includes <a href="http://getlittlebird.hs-sites.com/content-marketing-free-analysis?utm_campaign=Free%20Sample%20Report&utm_source=CMWorld">here</a>.  (Little Bird's social graph technology is language agnostic, too, so it can power discovery and engagement with people writing online anywhere in the world.)</p>
<p>The map from that report shows that this community really is global. Its leaders hail from all around the world, but especially from the Eastern US, the Western US, Europe and Australia.  If you're at the event, we hope to connect with you - but we also hope you'll connect with other new business contacts from all around the world.</p>
