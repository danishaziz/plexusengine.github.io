<p>Measuring social media is a complex, contentious and ever-changing field. Bulk metrics like page views and mentions have their place, but as you move upstream into more strategic uses of social - how do you put a number on learning, leadership and high-value intangibles?</p>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Katie_Paine___Flickr_-_Photo_Sharing_.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2252" alt="Katie_Paine___Flickr_-_Photo_Sharing_" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Katie_Paine___Flickr_-_Photo_Sharing_.jpg" width="290" height="357" align="right" /></a>That's a question we were looking at when our advisor <a href="https://twitter.com/jchernov">Joe Chernov</a> introduced us to <a href="http://twitter.com/queenofmetrics">Katie Paine</a>, a long-admired leader in social media measurement. I remember hearing great things about Katie Paine's work before I'd ever worked a day in social media. Our data shows she's had long-standing online relationships with leading practitioners and thinkers like <a href="https://twitter.com/jowyang">Jeremiah Owyang</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/danzarrella">Dan Zarrella</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rohitbhargava ">Rohit Bhargava</a> and many others. (Just to give you an idea of her provenance on the social web!)</p>
<p>That's why I'm so excited that our conversation with Katie led to this very generous blog post in which she calls Little Bird, "<a href="http://painepublishing.com/measurementadvisor/2014/07/09/the-best-new-thing-in-measurement-little-bird/">The best new thing in measurement</a>." And that after a conversation that included some heated debate!</p>
<p><strong>Katie zeroed right in on what makes Little Bird different, too.</strong> <em>"The difference between Little Bird and other systems like Traackr," she writes, "is in how they identify influencers. Most systems rely on key words and Boolean searches to identify the people who write frequently and with authority about your market or topic. Little Bird uses network analysis to identify the people with the largest, strongest network ties in your business. Most importantly, it isn’t just looking at Twitter or blog posts. It includes everything from Instagram to LinkedIn.</em></p>
<p>"The result is a system that is both fast and accurate. I know from experience that this is a great thing, since I’ve spent a goodly amount of time developing key word searches that are both broad enough to find influencers yet accurate enough to be on topic."</p>
<p>Thanks, Katie! We couldn't have said it better ourselves.</p>
<p>What comes next, after discovery and measurement? Learning from the best, engaging with them online, growing your social capital and measuring the results! All using the power of the social graph, the ungameable measure of influence powered by peer validation.</p>
