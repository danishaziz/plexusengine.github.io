<p>When you've already got Seth Godin and Nate Silver keynoting your company's marketing conference, how can you make things even bigger? That was the question organizers of the <a href="http://Hubspot.com">HubSpot</a> conference <a href="http://inbound.com">Inbound</a>, this week in Boston, asked themselves this Summer.</p>
<p>To explore their options, the company turned to <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>. <strong>In addition to helping you discover and engage with the world's leading experts and influencers in any market, Little Bird can also help discover which of them are already in your existing online community. </strong></p>
<p>Little Bird is a happy HubSpot customer and HubSpot co-founder <a href="http://twitter.com/Dharmesh">Dharmesh Shah</a> is an investor in Little Bird, but this research was carried out independently by Laura Fitton (<a href="http://twitter.com/pistachio">@pistachio</a>), who's responsible for HubSpot's Influencer Relations. Knowing the best tools to use in social business is something Laura's world-famous for.</p>
<p>"I've been very impressed with what Little Bird can do," Fitton says. "It's an awesome way to develop and keep track of key relationships online. It's such a challenge to avoid being overwhelmed on the social web, businesses need tools like this to really focus their energy."</p>
<p><em><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2013/08/inbound-marketing-i-will-email-you-yes-you-your-big-opportunities-to-connect/">See who you're already connected to</a>, or ought to connect with, in the world of Inbound Marketing with a free Little Bird data preview.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here's how HubSpot did it.</strong> First, Fitton ran a number of Little Bird reports on different topics relevant to the conference. Then, she plugged in several of their key executives on the Compare page, which compares the social connections of any individual to the leaders in the topic of the report. One of those analyses surfaced an incredible connection: <a href="https://twitter.com/ariannahuff">Arianna Huffington</a>!</p>
<p>Little Bird told the organizers that Huffington had accepted a connection on Twitter to a member of their team, so they reached out and made contact with their now-keynote speaker. Of course they had to make all the arrangements with the very busy media innovator, but it was by using Little Bird's automated analysis of hundreds of thousands of connections online that the option of contacting Huffington even came to mind. "We believe that having DMed Arianna directly contributed to convincing her to participate," Fitton says.</p>
<p>Your company may have valuable strong connections otherwise lost in the history of your social network engagement as well. Little Bird can help you find them and make use of them with a snap of your fingers. Even better, Little BIrd can help you form those connections with brand new influencers and experts, with more effective and efficient use of social media.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see how Little Bird works, I'll be in Boston at Inbound and would be happy to show you! I'm really excited about attending the event and meeting thousands of other people working to unlock the opportunities created by social media and social networks.</p>
