<div><a href="http://www.caravanstudios.org/">Caravan Studios</a> is a mobile app development organization focused on supporting social change efforts.  One of its recent apps, called <a href="http://www.caravanstudios.org/#!safenight/cfvg">SafeNight</a>, allows women's shelters to put out a call to action to their supporters to chip in to pay for emergency hotel rooms: it's on-demand mobile crowd-funding.</div>

<p>The Caravan Studios team used <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a> to quickly learn who the most influential leaders in relevant fields are, nationally, while deploying a local pilot version of the app.  They used Little Bird's <em>Daily Mission emails</em> and content tracking features to quickly learn about key matters of interest to national leaders, to build an understanding of how those communities engage with the issues they focus on and to discover new opportunities to grow their connections in the field.</p>
<p>With help from Little Bird data, Caravan Studios discovered, applied for and was awarded a $1 million grant to take their local pilot national.  "And when we attended a D.C. gathering of grant finalists," CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/webb">Marnie Webb</a> says, "<em>we were already familiar with many of the issues being discussed by the community because we'd been watching the key developments in their conversations online using Little Bird.</em>  That felt really good."</p>
<p>Congratulations on securing support for this very important application, Marnie!</p>
