<p>Before every call and meeting we have with external companies, we fire up a few relevant <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a> reports and super-charge our preparation with graph-powered research. These small steps can deliver big wins fast.</p>
<p>Many Little Bird users who practice social selling do this kind of research already, but I think it can be super helpful for everyone.</p>
<p>Here's how you can do it. You can follow all of these steps on your desktop or your mobile web browser.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I. Run a Little Bird report <strong>on your contact's company</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>See who's at the top of that community</li>
<li>See what's hot in the company's online community by visiting the Share and Engage page</li>
<li>See where your contact stands in the Discover Connections page
<ul>
<li>How connected are they?</li>
<li>Who did they connect with first? That will tell you a lot about their background and relationship with the company</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>See where you and your company stand in the Discover Connections page
<ul>
<li>Who else do you know and who knows you?</li>
<li>Who else at the company knows about your company?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><center>Below: Let's say I was about to call someone from the incredible data science company <a href="http://Kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>...</center><em></em><br />
<a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Discover_Connections___kaggle.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3180" alt="Discover_Connections___kaggle" src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Discover_Connections___kaggle.jpg" width="600" /></a><br />
II. Run a report on their <strong>industry or market</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>See what's hot in that sector, so you've got it on your radar and can talk about it if the opportunity arises to demonstrate your familiarity</li>
<li>See how connected the person you'll be talking to is by using the Discover Connections page
<ul>
<li>How savvy are they? (Who do they know to follow?)</li>
<li>How influential are they? (Who knows and follows them?)</li>
<li>Who did they first connect with among thought leaders in the industry?</li>
<li>Who have they recently been paying attention to and forming new connections with?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>III. Have a report ready on your competitors, too (ask your Customer Success guide for help if you don't have one of these already created)</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug the person you're talking to into Discover Connections and see how familiar with your competitors they are</li>
<li>See which, if any, they've had long-running connections with and who they've connected with recently.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you get this flow down, you can do it quickly and it can make a huge difference in how you communicate with people - it puts them in context by analyzing their connections.</p>
