  content: This is a great move Marshall. Will that part be visible and free to users?
    And isn't this similar to your existing service, though?

  content: William, thanks for the encouraging words.  We're focused on business users
    who can leverage this data to capture big value.  That's one important way we're
    different from Technorati's free ad-supported model.  I've been part of building
    free ad-supported businesses in the past - and there may be some free access to
    some Little Bird data in the future, but for now I'm aiming to pay my team with
    revenue from sales.

<p>News <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/06/23/technorati-quietly-killed-its-once-authoritative-blog-ranking-system-in-may/">hit the tech blogs this week</a> that one of the most useful blog discovery tools of the early social media era, <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati's</a> index, has been shut down. It used to be <em>the place</em> you'd go to find the best blogs on a topic of interest to you. It was probably way too far ahead of its time, though (business interest in blogs was too nascent to drive enough traffic and ad viewership to a free index to justify the expense of maintaining the system, I'd guess). Technorati the business is alive and well as an ad network, but the blog index is gone.</p>
<p>Here at <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>, we think there's huge value not just in finding content that contains certain keywords, like traditional social media monitoring products find, but also in finding great sources that are likely to create great content in the future. That's what we do.</p>
<p><strong>Technorati had a global top 100 list </strong>(trivia: who were the only authors who wrote professionally on more than 1 of the top 10 blogs in the global Technorati index? Engadget &amp; Gizmodo's Peter Rojas and <a href="http://marshallk.com/media">me</a> at TechCrunch &amp; ReadWriteWeb). You could also search for topics and find a list of blogs ranked that were related to that particular topic. Ranking was based on something like a blog-specific pagerank and it was pretty good. Technorati's business model allowed anyone to see the blog discovery for free, but the ad network that paid the bills ate the whole company in time. Here at Little Bird we sell access to the tools to discover the data and strategic collaboration for making use of that data.</p>
<p><center>Below: A preview of top 3D Design blogs, one part of a Little Bird report.</center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Welcome_to_Little_Bird_-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Welcome_to_Little_Bird_-3.jpg" alt="Welcome_to_Little_Bird_-3" width="563" height="738" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2844" /></a></center><strong>Author authority: ticket to the future</strong></p>
<p>Blog discovery and ranking is an important part of what we do here at Little Bird, too. Little Bird customers are able to search on any topic and in addition to finding the most-connected people on Twitter, then LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Google+ and elsewhere, we find the top blogs in that community.</p>
<p>Much as Google has expanded beyond PageRank to include AuthorRank, or the influence of the author of a piece of content, Little Bird ranks blogs by the inbound connections from peers of each blog's author.</p>
<p>Little Bird customers <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2013/09/enter-new-markets-fast-how-startup-orchestrate-io-uses-little-bird/">do things like</a> look over top blogs in their target markets to discover what topics people are talking about and how they talk about them. Then they create their own content that's responsive and industry-appropriateâ€”one example of how people use Little Bird for what we call Owned Content Optimization.</p>
<p>In a world of tweets and other short-form content, blogs still deliver a ton of important information and audience. We take great pride in offering a new way to discover them. We'd love to <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">show you more</a>.</p>
