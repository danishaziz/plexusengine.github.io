  content: Good stuff, thanks for the update Danish - and thanks to the Dev team for
    making this happen.  This is one of my favorite examples of how Little Bird isn't
    just about finding a list of influencers - it uses that list to surface all kinds
    of other valuable information as well!

    internet sites on the net, even though they aren\x92t linked to us, by linking
    to them. Underneath are some webpages worth checking out."

<h3>See Any User's Standing in a Topical Community</h3>
<p>Our customers have been asking for easier ways to quickly see how connected any person or company is within a specific topical community. For example, you could enter the Twitter username of a potential event speaker, sales prospect, hiring candidate, or acquisition target to quickly see their standing in a community central to your business. Today we added an additional feature—<strong>Standing</strong>—to show you exactly that information, even if that user isn't included in the report.</p>
<p>You'll see this new Standing feature at the top of Little Bird's existing <strong>Discover Connections</strong> view, which gives you a current, detailed look at any Twitter user's stature, savvy, and connections in the community of topical Insiders delivered by a Little Bird report. This Standing feature adds new, summary information to the existing details already included in Discover Connections, like topic Insiders identified as <strong>Missed Opportunities</strong>, <strong>Not Yet Converted</strong>, <strong>Most Recent Insiders</strong>, <strong>First Insiders</strong>, and <strong>Most Recent Following</strong>.</p>
