  Marshall on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/marshallk\" target=\"_blank\">Marshall

  Kardashian was once <a title=\"read more\" href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/01/how-much-can-a-celebrity-make-for-tweeting.html?mid=nymag_press
  \" target=\"_blank\">paid $10,000 to Tweet</a> about an online shoe company—is that
  the pinnacle of influencer engagement online? I'd argue just the opposite—that might
  have been an all-time low-point in the world's understanding of social media.\r\n\r\nThe
  self-publishing revolution of social media has enabled any of us to pull up a seat
  directly in front of some of the world's leading thinkers and stars—and what do
  we do with that opportunity? All too often, we tug at their shirtsleeves and plead
  with them to tell their audiences about us. That can certainly happen, it's great
  when these people do talk about us, but there's so much more value to be captured
  by the radical new access we have today thanks to social media.\r\n\r\nBusinesses
  that look at social media as a source of free or cheap promotion are really missing
  out. I think more people realize that every day, but I think when it comes to online
  influencer identification: counterpoints to \"influencers as promotional vehicles\"
  need to be articulated and amplified.\r\n\r\nWhen it does come to promotion of your
  brand by an independent influencer online, promotion is more likely to happen and
  be more meaningful if you've also taken advantage of these other opportunities to
  generate and capture value along the way."

  content: "Nice post, Marshall, you're the man.  And you're right to note that your
    customers have much to gain by engaging relevant influencers in a deeper exchange
    of ideas about their core business -- something that can deliver more durable
    value than the ephemeral Twitter endorsement or media \"placement\".\r\n\r\nYour
    Kim Kardashian example does a good job of describing how to align interests between
    the \"expert\" and the firm.  One company that has done a stellar job of building
    value-added relationships with independent third parties is SAP.  Their constituency
    typically isn't quite as high-profile as Ms. Kardashian, but the operating model
    is the same ;-)\r\n\r\nEthan"

    work, but I do know that people throughout their organization watch Jonathan Becher,
    Vishal Sikka, Sanjay Poonen and Oliver Bussmann online more than anyone else in
    the organization.  (A Little Bird told me. ;)  Anyone else in particular that
    you'd recommend paying attention to there? Maybe Lars Dalgaard or Lindsey La Manna?

  content: Great post, Marshall. I agree that the highest value of influencer interaction
    comes from learning. We too often place a premium on influencers as defined by
    their Klout scores, meaning we place more value on their role as amplifiers as
    opposed to how they can give back to you (and thus influence you). On the other
    hand, high-profile influencers from the consulting ranks will only share so much
    insight in an open, social setting before they want to take the conversation to
    a closed environment where they can charge for their thinking (which is totally
    fine -- they have businesses to run, bills to pay, and mouths to feed). If you
    are willing to cast your net far and wide and receive smaller nuggets of wisdom
    for free (which is a valid model for anyone who has the time and skills to synthesize
    such insights), then indeed influencers provide immense value via social media.
    Keep up the insightful posts!

  content: "Marshall, your point about the value received for paying Kardashian to
    tweet, makes me wonder -- what's the delta between \"short-term fad influence\"
    and \"lasting meaningful influence?\"\r\n\r\nGranted, perhaps in the realm of
    B2C marketing there are times when you can benefit from a celebrity endorsement,
    but those days seem numbered (if you believe the research about how consumers
    value online authenticity).\r\n\r\nIn a B2B environment, I'm guessing that a shallow
    endorsement has minimal short- or long-term value. In fact, it may do more harm
    than good."

That can certainly happen, it's great when these people do talk about us, but there's so much more value to be captured by the radical new access we have today thanks to social media.</p>
<p>Businesses that look at social media as a source of free or cheap promotion are really missing out. I think more people realize that every day, but I think when it comes to online influencer identification: counterpoints to "influencers as promotional vehicles" need to be articulated and amplified.</p>
<p>When it does come to promotion of your brand by an independent influencer online, promotion is more likely to happen and be more meaningful if you've also taken advantage of these other opportunities to generate and capture value along the way.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-127"></a></p>
<h4>High leverage learning</h4>
<p>Is there anything more valuable than learning something new that changes the way you look at work or the world around you? A reservoir of knowledge, compiled through experience, connections, study and practice, is a powerful foundation to increase the impact of everything you do. Each new big learning experience is a catalyst to kickstart the effectiveness of your work.</p>
<blockquote><p>Little Bird top influencers in Professional Development, in general: <a title="read more" href="href=&quot;http://www.kikerlearning.com&quot;" target="_blank">Rich Kiker</a>, <a title="read more" href="http://bit.ly/ShellTerrell" target="_blank">Shelly Terrell</a> and <a title="read more" href="http://www.kylepace.com" target="_blank">Kyle Pace</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing flies as fast across the web these days as an infographic or a numbered list. Why? Because both are items you can very quickly glean glimmers of knowledge from. That's the fruit of editorial labor, like pressure turning coal into a diamond. That's what people at the top of their fields in social media can offer, too, in a world swimming with mediocre content.</p>
<p>What if the best gift a top market influencer could share with you was not their voice, but their mind? People at the top of their game aren't just good at doing what they do—they're really good at learning how to do it better. I bet that shoe company could have captured a lot more long-term promotional impact by engaging meaningfully with Kim Kardashian, her team of publicists and strongest connections, than they did by crassly paying her to Tweet. Who knows. Perhaps they did both.</p>
<p>Once you've identified the most influential experts in a particular field, the first step is to be quiet and listen. The longer you can listen, the more you'll learn; the more you engage humbly, the more likely those influencers will amplify your message later. What do you call a well-informed, respectful, sustained engagement? A relationship.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to use our service here at Little Bird, but some of my favorite use cases are when customers just use our tools to find people to learn from. The faster you can find the strongest minds in your field, the faster you can dive deep into learning and the more you can get out of it. For creating content, for advising clients, for whatever kind of work that you do.</p>
<h4>A rocket ship into the future</h4>
<p>Finding out who's sharing important information about a topic of interest right now is useful, but finding out who's likely to share important information in the future offers competitive advantage.</p>

<p>When I worked as a journalist, I used systematic methods to identify where information was most likely to bubble up early in the news cycle—then I set up systems to sit by those sources and watch (using automation, alerts, etc.) so that I could jump on any breaking news they found before my competitors.</p>
<p>Now, working as a entrepreneur in a new market (research and marketing technology), I'm using technology to identify people who've won the respect of their peers and who I should prioritize engaging with in the limited time I have while building a company. (We're participating in a startup incubator, too, where the people in charge exercise their editorial judgement in selecting speakers to schedule.)</p>
<p>Online, top influencers are best engaged-with as a long-term investment. If you can defer your need for help with promotion and just focus on learning and adding value, then you'll be more likely to have access to much greater opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>Those are some of my thoughts about the non-promotional value you can capture through effective engagement with top influencers in your industry. I'd love to read about your thoughts. Feel free to share them in comments below, I'm sure everyone would like to read them!</p>
