    Marshall, great post and I am glad 2 of my posts helped your thinking on this blog.


    I agree with you that access to your whole network to find the right person to help solve a problem that in turn will delight a customer is good not just for business but also for employee satisfaction.


    My "why I'm staking my career on social business" post seems to have struck a chord - and I am glad. Social business is the way forward - and it is time companies stop investing endless money into getting more likes and followers, or in having an "influencer" like their stuff, and instead invest in becoming a social business.

  content: Little Bird for internal social networks that bridge to the supply chain…
    put your thinking cap on Marshall!  The company and its external touch points
    ARE the business.  And guess what?  It's a network.

  content: Great post Marshall. You've captured my mantra quite well. Leading companies
    will build systems around these experts to align and scale impact in pursuit of
    business goals. Such a system will include discovery, enablement, business intelligence
    and measurement/performance feedback to help these engaged employees focus their
    outreach efforts where they can best contribute knowledge, expertise and experience
    directly and in context of the needs of the customer/prospect. Designed for efficiency
    and effectiveness, quality over quantity. Helping employees fine tune their engagement
    based on the understanding of which efforts are paying off / or not. Work smarter
    not harder.

<p> <em>4 minute read. Summary: Business can capture value from social networks by sourcing external partnerships, by discovering and empowering their most influential employees and by surfacing latent connections to influential people hidden in their existing online communities.</em> </p>
<p> What's the difference between the terms social media and social business?  Do the differences and the overlap present important business opportunity? I believe they do, possibly in many ways. Below are three valuable places the internal and the external social worlds intersect regarding subject matter experts, for example. </p>
<p> <strong>A jargon-free way to ask this question might be:</strong> where do external social networks and internal business functions intersect in a way that can be valuable, beyond having famous people post about your company's stuff? (That's cool, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.) </p>
<p><a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LBofficeAug11.jpg"><img src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/LBofficeAug11.jpg" alt="LBofficeAug11" width="1606" height="714" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2935" /></a><br />
<em>Above: Some of the Little Bird team members hard at work, turning social media data into social business value for you. That's <a href="http://twitter.com/jessicarickson">Jess</a> in Sales, <a href="http://twitter.com/burnstrong">Darby</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/noahsiekmann">Noah</a> in Customer Success.</em></p>
<p>IBM's Andrew Grill writes in a new blog post titled <a href="http://social.bz/why-im-staking-my-career-on-the-growth-of-social-business/">Why I’m staking my career on the growth of social business</a> the following: "A social business is an organization whose culture and systems encourage networks of people to create business value." Focusing on internal collaboration, he goes on to say "For me, internal collaboration is the new way of working, and in the future your value to an organisation won’t be what you know, it will be what you share." </p>
<p> The two are inter-related, though, as is well articulated by an analogy Grill blogged about a year ago in another post titled <a href="http://social.bz/using-a-broadway-show-to-explain-the-differences-between-social-media-and-social-business/">Using a broadway show to explain the differences between social media and social business</a>.  There he argues that social media is like the on-stage public-facing part of a Broadway play, and social business is like the behind-the-scenes world of theater techs: lighting rigs and pulleys and curtains and ladders.  Grill writes: "everything that is going on front of house is integrated, processed and shared with the back of house team to ensure the product being delivered on stage is of the highest quality available." </p>
<p> I like that way of thinking. </p>
<p> However, there is one part of Grill's thinking that I want to extend upon.  In his most recent post, he says that among the qualities of a social business "a social business knows instantly how to find subject matter experts – because they make themselves easy to find."  I don't think it's that simple; I think there are some specific ways to tease a lot of value out of the places where social business, social media and subject matter experts all intersect. (Incidentally, these are all things <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">we can leverage automation</a> to help with.) </p>
<p>* There's a ton of <strong>valuable knowledge in the network outside your company's walls</strong> - no matter how big you are - discovering it and bringing it inside offers a strategic advantage.  Listening to important people talk about the future of your industry and engaging with them offers even greater forms of value than advocacy.  I thought <a href="http://dionhinchcliffe.com/">Dion Hinchcliffe</a> explained this really well when he recently <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/social-business/discussion-point-where-does-hr-go-from-here-025938.php">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>"The network-centric organizations of tomorrow will innately understand that the best available resources to accomplish work are largely elsewhere, in other ecosystems, even frequently well outside the traditionally accepted boundaries of the company. An updated, more network-centric view of HR would provide a look at how human resources can be refactored to cultivate — in scale — communities of interest/partnership, more effectively tap into them and elicit their participation (work) using joint goals, all realized in very short time periods.</p></blockquote>
<p> See also Hinchcliffe's post last week, <a href="http://dionhinchcliffe.com/2014/08/04/let-the-network-do-the-work/">Let the network do the work</a>.   (Little Bird users, see the Share and Engage page in your reports for the best examples of this.) </p>
<p>See even further Valis Krebs' <a href="http://orgnet.com/IHJour_XII_No5_p38_42.pdf">Social Capital: The Key to Success for the 21st Century Organization</a> (h/t <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/+LuisSuarezElsua/posts?cfem=1">Luis Suarez</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>The new advantage is context - how internal and external content is interpreted, combined, made sense of, and converted to new products and services.  Creating competitive context requires social capital - the ability to find, utilize and combine the skills, knowledge and experience of others, inside and outside of the organization. Social capital is derived from employees' professional and business networks.</p></blockquote>
<p> * <strong>Some organizations are big enough that discovering Subject Matter Experts is a challenge</strong>; in enterprise organizations there's great value in discovering which company insiders have won the respect of external communities of specialists and amplifying their voices.  That's something we learned more about from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sfemerick">Susan Emerick</a> (now an independent consultant on employee advocacy) and the incredible <a href="http://www.ibm.com/blogs/zz/en/guidelines.html">IBM Social Computing Guidelines</a>.  It's not just about getting your employees to share your company's news on the social web - it's about finding out which of your employees have earned a lot of social capital in their respective fields, empowering them with resources, and identifying future prospective leaders among your ranks.  In other words: Increasing the impact and quantity of the thought leaders in your company's employ.   That's not about growing Twitter followers and Facebook friends - it's about impacting the market in the way you believe it ought to move and growing your company's reputation for effective thought leadership. (Little Bird users, ask your Customer Success contact for help with this.) </p>
<p> * Finally, there are key intersections between external thought leaders and internal ones.  An enterprise company has so many millions of contacts that even strong connections to trusted experts can get lost like needles in a haystack.  Enabling your company <strong>to quickly surface the key external connections today that it's made over the months and years of social interaction in the past</strong> is another key opportunity to capture and transmit value from social media to social business. (<a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a> users, put your company and related accounts into the Discover Connections page on any report to surface some of this.)<br />
I imagine there are many more ways that social business and social media overlap, but those are the types of intersections we think about here a lot.</p>
<p>What about you? Are there specific places of intersection between the external world of social media and the internal world of social business that you've found are good sources of value?</p>
