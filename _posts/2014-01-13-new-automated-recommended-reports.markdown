<p>We're excited to unveil the first iteration of a big new feature here at <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>. We've been using the code name <em>"Magic"</em> while building it.</p>
<p>Here's the magic: when you visit the new report creation page on Little Bird, we'll now give you a series of personalized topic selections you can click just once and get a great Little Bird report.</p>
<p><em>These are topics you know and love, ready for you to turn up your game, find highly-relevant content on subjects that matter to you, and jump efficiently into making connections with the most influential people online. Now Little Bird makes it even quicker and easier to  build expertise and connections to increase your stature and sales or curate and create content to inspire your audiences.</em></p>
<p>The recommendations are powered by the people you're already following on Twitter. Based on what we can learn about those people, we figure out which topics or industries we can analyze for you to engage with.</p>
<p>Senior developer <a href="http://twitter.com/dgaff">Devin Gaffney</a>, who built the feature, says "Little Bird is getting to a scale where we can start looking inward at our own data to provide totally new insights, far beyond what we can get from outside sources alone."</p>
<p><a name="datadiscovery"></a><strong>General trend: Discovery through analysis of data - not just for advertisers, for users too!</strong></p>
<p>Beyond what we're doing here, we believe that there's a general trend across the internet where people are beginning to discover opportunities for discovery in analyzing peoples' data. In this case, we're analyzing the people you've chosen to follow on Twitter - but there are lots of other people doing discovery based on the trail of data we leave everywhere we go.</p>
<p>It's one thing for that discovery to be done for the benefit of advertisers - but that's not all there is here at all! There are huge opportunities for this discovery to be done for the benefit of end users ourselves. Other cool examples of this kind of work I've seen lately include Intel's analysis of car and phone location data in conjunction with ethnographic research (see researcher <a href="http://rachelshadoan.com/category/work/">Rachel Shadoan's work</a>, for example) and <a href="http://www.expectlabs.com/mindmeld/">Mind Meld's neat (if beta) iPad app</a>, which recommends links online based on the words you use in a web conference. There's huge opportunity to learn more about the world by illuminating knowledge hidden in our data!</p>
<p>Mind Meld is an interesting example because that app tries to serve up information you might find useful without your even having to ask for it. That's a paradigm people have begun referring to as <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/09/11/new-app-mindmeld-heralds-the-era-of-anticipatory-computing/">Anticipatory Computing</a>, and one that Little Bird finds some inspiration from in our Magic feature as well. Look for more of this from us...when you expect it least! ;)</p>
<p>What are some other examples you'd recommend we check out?</p>
<p><em>About Little Bird again...</em></p>
<p>Our new "Magic" feature is pretty awesome and it's getting smarter every day. I love seeing people get recommendations like 3D Printing, Inbound Marketing, or this morning I was recommended a report on Postmodernism. Cool!</p>
<p>This is just the first iteration of this feature but we think there's a ton of value for everyone here.</p>
<p>So give your magic recommendations a click and come see what Little Bird can do to help you grow your business every day. Check out the Share and Engage page, sign up for daily mission emails and more.</p>
<p>Together we'll use data to help you learn from and do business with the smartest people in the world, faster and easier than ever before!</p>
