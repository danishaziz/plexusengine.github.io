<h4>
<span style="color:#E45845;">Social Intelligence Platform: Discover, Engage & Analyze</span><br />
</h4>
<p>The Little Bird application allows you to identify peer-validated thought leaders in minutes. You can then learn from them, engage with them, and share their content, right from your Little Bird dashboard.</p>
<p>Little Bird focuses on people and connections inside a network—not just the content people post and popularity they can fake. The only way to move up the ranks is to earn the trust of your peers. </p>
<p>Automating influencer discovery reduces the time to create reports from days or weeks to just minutes, freeing your team to focus on engagement—the aspect of influence marketing that humans do best.</p>
<ul class="birddet">
<li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Identify hundreds to thousands of influencers across multiple topics and track their hottest conversations at scale.</li>
<li><strong>Repeatable:</strong> Get fast, on-demand access to intelligence relevant to the evolving needs of your business and market landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Quantifiable:</strong> Track and measure audience, engagement, content performance and connections over time.</li>
</ul>
