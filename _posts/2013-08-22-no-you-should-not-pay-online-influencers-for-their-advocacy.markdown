  content: "Hi Marshall, I think you're dead wrong here.  Asking for free advice doesn't
    scale (even if little bird does). This may work for some, but the vast majority
    of influencers require a monetizable solution.  \n\n\nPayment is just a filter,
    it does not have to mean parroting. To think that A-List celebrities are going
    to let brands \"pick their brain\" for free while they make millions off the deal
    amounts to the NCAA and EA sports taking advantage of the \"likeliness\" of college
    football players while making billions off jerseys, video games, and TV while
    paying them in peanuts.\n\n\nPay-for-play is the point.  They aren't called influencers
    for nothing, they earned it."

  content: Hi Christopher, thanks for offering a counter-point here!  It sounds like
    we have very different contexts in mind.  College football players were not at
    all the people I had in mind when writing this.  I suspect, though, that even
    if I was looking to do business in the world of football, I would start by developing
    relationships with key people like scouts, coaches, ex-players and others as a
    way to become a known entity in that market and to benefit from the discourse
    those people participate in.  Would I jump into a new market, find the most popular,
    influential people and start throwing money at them to endorse my products?  Even
    in sports, I would not do that.  Maybe I'm missing the point though, if in some
    markets pay-for-play is the point as you say.  I thought playing football was
    the point in football, but I know there are all kinds of economics involved.  Would
    you disagree with my suggestion that non-monetary relationship building is an
    essential first step in doing business with the upper echelon of markets like
    sports, too?  Again, thanks for vocalizing your disagreement - I'm sure you're
    not the only one that feels that way.

    online influencers.  But at some point Beyonce is going to say you have to put
    a "ring on it"

  content: "Hey there Marshall,\n\nI'll have to disagree with you here. I wrote a
    post over at the InNetwork blog on this recently:\n\nhttp://innetwork.net/2013/06/why-influencers-deserve-to-be-paid/\n\nSome
    key points from the post:\n\n<i>There’s much more to a blog post than just stringing
    some words \ntogether (or images and sounds, if you’re a video blogger or podcaster).\n\n-
    Ideas and research;\n- Content;\n- Format;\n- Links and attribution to relevant
    topics;\n- Images and media;\n- Proofreading.\n\nThat’s just the creation part.
    Then you have the marketing of a post,\n along with replying to comments and encouraging
    further discussion. All\n told, a blog post can easily take up a few days of your
    time, if you \nwere to add up all the components.</i>\n\n\n\nThat's from the blogger/content
    creator angle. Then there's the years of expertise you're gaining attention from,
    as well as real relevance versus the slapshot approach of a Klout or similar.
    That shouldn't be given up for free.\n\n\nLooking forward to chatting on Tuesday,
    perhaps we can dive deeper into this. :)"

  content: "I'm curious why you believe that online influencers should be giving away
    all their knowledge and influence away for free? They didn't get that influence
    overnight. They worked very hard to cultivate a community and they give back to
    that community by sharing every day. If a brand wants to tap into that, they should
    be paying. \n\n\nI don't have a problem if someone has a question or if a brand
    asks a question, that is part of networking and building relationships. If they
    want access to my audience, that is a completely different ball game.\n\n\nAs
    John Andrews wrote on Ted Rubin's blog http://bit.ly/LV3AsH, brands wouldn't expect
    Time Warner to give them free advertising. The brands are asking for access to
    Time Warner's audience which is exactly what brands are asking of online influencers.
    \n\n\nWhat makes those two different?"

<p>The hottest link of the day today among experts in Social Business is a Harvard Business Review blog post titled <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/08/yes_marketers_you_should_pay.html">Yes, Marketers, You Should Pay Your Influencers</a>. I thought it warranted a quick response. Here at <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a> we provide technology for ethical, and thus effective, influencer marketing and social business.</p>
<p><center><img alt="" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Yes__Marketers__You_Should_Pay_Your_Influencers_-_Teresa_M._Caro_-_Harvard_Business_Review-2.png" width="500px" /></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center>Oh, beloved HBR, how sad I was to read this!</center>Don't lower yourself to pay-for-play and miss the point. This is something we went right after in the very first post on this blog: <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2012/11/the-true-value-of-online-influencers-its-not-about-parroting-your-messages/">The true value of online influencers: It’s not about parroting your messages</a>.</p>
<p>As we wrote there:</p>
<blockquote><p>The self-publishing revolution of social media has enabled any of us to pull up a seat directly in front of some of the world’s leading thinkers and stars—and what do we do with that opportunity? All too often, we tug at their shirtsleeves and plead with them to tell their audiences about us. That can certainly happen, it’s great when these people do talk about us, but there’s so much more value to be captured by the radical new access we have today thanks to social media.</p>
<p>Businesses that look at social media as a source of free or cheap promotion are really missing out.</p></blockquote>
<p>What are they missing out on most? High-leverage learning and early access to future business opportunities. More detail in the blog post above.</p>
<p>Analogy: pay-for-play endorsement is to social media like D-list celebrity infomercials are to the Guttenberg printing press. Sure, when there's a new media that emerges, there's going to be a long fall to the bottom of the opportunities it offers, but why on earth would we start there?</p>
<p>Perhaps because we don't know any other options. Here's one option, based on science, with the benefit of getting some promotion for you - but most importantly in discovering new opportunities for you and your company: <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2013/04/how-to-influence-the-influencers-ask-for-their-advice/">How to Influence the Influencers: Ask for Their Advice</a>.</p>
<p>From Wharton School Professor Adam Grant's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670026557/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0670026557&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=spacforrent-20">Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“New research shows that advice seeking is a surprisingly effective strategy for exercising influence when we lack authority.</p>
<p>"Asking for advice encouraged greater cooperation and information sharing, turning a potentially contentious negotiation into a win-win deal. Studies demonstrate that across the manufacturing, financial services, insurance, and pharmaceuticals industries, seeking advice is among the most effective ways to influence peers, superiors, and subordinates. Advice seeking tends to be significantly more persuasive than the taker’s preferred tactics of pressuring subordinates and ingratiating superiors. Advice seeking is also consistently more influential than the matcher’s default approach of trading favors.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And why stop there? <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2013/05/i-found-the-leaders-in-my-field-now-what/">I Found the Leaders in My Field, Now What?</a> You want raw monetization? Our team member Nate Angel wrote <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2013/03/how-i-use-little-bird-to-be-smarter-richer-more-famous/">How I Use Little Bird to be Smarter, Richer &amp; More Famous</a>.</p>
<p>The point is, the opportunities are many and very exciting. Don't lower yourself to pay-for-play and miss the point. Come on in, the water's fine! It's better than fine, it's fantastic!</p>
