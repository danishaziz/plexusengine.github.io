  Newsle!</em>\r\n\r\nThere's nothing as interesting to people as information about
  ourselves. Most of us aren't in the news every day, but you might be surprised how
  often someone one degree away from you is!\r\n\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Newsle_-_Home-4.jpg\"

  announced</a> that it has acquired <a href=\"http://newsle.com\">Newsle</a> (I pronounce
  it like News'-el, others say News-lee'), a super-cool technology that tells you
  when people you know online are in the news. You sync up your LinkedIn and Facebook
  accounts and it sends you an email with article previews - it's like Google Alerts
  for your friends and professional contacts. You should go try it.\r\n\r\nPeople
  LOVE Newsle, I hear people talk about it all the time. That and <a href=\"http://refresh.io\">Refresh.io</a>.\r\n"

<p><em>From one social connection data company to another - congratulations, Newsle!</em></p>
<p>There's nothing as interesting to people as information about ourselves. Most of us aren't in the news every day, but you might be surprised how often someone one degree away from you is!</p>

<p>Today <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/140714/p8#a140714p8">LinkedIn announced</a> that it has acquired <a href="http://newsle.com">Newsle</a> (I pronounce it like News'-el, others say News-lee'), a super-cool technology that tells you when people you know online are in the news. You sync up your LinkedIn and Facebook accounts and it sends you an email with article previews - it's like Google Alerts for your friends and professional contacts. You should go try it.</p>
<p>People LOVE Newsle, I hear people talk about it all the time. That and <a href="http://refresh.io">Refresh.io</a>.<br />

<strong>Why is Newsle so compelling?</strong> I think it's because it's a great combination of technology and humanity - which respects the line between the two. The Newsle team has built a machine learning system that does a really good job telling the difference between people with the same names and spidering across the news really quickly.</p>
<p>All that tech is on the back end and we users just see a stream of big pictures of the faces of our friends and links to things those friends are celebrating. Your friend made a big announcement, maybe they won something, maybe they got a promotion, maybe the media asked for their opinion about something.</p>
<p>No matter what the reason, you probably hadn't been thinking about that person until BAM - they had a life highlight and you got notified. You got to be there for them for their happy time. (Most news about individual people is happy.) That's an emotionally rewarding experience.</p>
<p><strong>Here at Little Bird we talk a lot about "intelligent machines helping humble humans." I bet that resonates with the Newsle team, too.</strong></p>
<p>Newsle told me a few months ago that they have an iPhone app with push notifications coming soon. I hope today's news doesn't derail that. You may have noticed that LinkedIn is already doing "your friend was in the news" notes, too, but they weren't as good as Newsle's. Hopefully the emails will continue to live on, hopefully they'll continue to support Facebook contacts and hopefully they'll sync up with Rapportive for your email sidebar! (?)</p>
<p>Here at <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>, we think that the connections between people are really valuable as well. We look at the people you're connected to, but also the people you're not yet connected to, as part of our larger analysis of communities of Subject Matter Experts and the things they're excited about.</p>
<p>I've got to hand it to the Newsle team, though, they really struck a vein where technology and the human experience can come together.</p>
