You've invested a lot of resources and you're making a big bet on your new work making a major splash.</p>
<p><em>Who are you going to tell about the project when it's time to announce it?</em>  Who do you already know that would be good to tell - and who ought you know?  Are there influential people online that you should reach out to and if so, is there a more effective way to find them than by searching for keywords in the messages they've posted on Twitter or Facebook?</p>
<p>Influencer identification and engagement to maximize your online marketing reach is one of the things <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a> can help with. </p>
<p>It's one of two big problems the Little Bird customers use our technology and support to solve.</p>
<ul>
<li>Targeted outreach: The social web is noisy and it's hard to know who to focus on in order to grow your marketing reach.  Little Bird zeroes in on who influences the influencers.</li>
<li>
Fewer surprises: Traditional social media monitoring and keyword search can only discover what's already happened, leaving a large element of surprise in the "unknown unknowns" that emerge on the social web.  Little Bird helps companies watch key people who likely to discover important information early in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Influencer discovery to grow marketing reach</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of millions of people participating on the social web, posting billions of messages online, and marketers struggle to find the right people to focus on to build relationships that will expand their reach online and offline.</p>
<p>Little Bird discovers who influences the influencers and who the most trusted experts are online in the context of a specific market or topic. Then we help build and measure earned influencer relationships that can be leveraged around announcements and that result in perpetual advocacy year round.   Those relationships grow market visibility, credibility, traffic, conversions and revenue.</p>
<p><em>What that looks like</em></p>
<p>Several months ago, a multi-billion dollar industrial software company came to Little Bird in anticipation of several product launches.  They asked for our help identifying which thought leaders in relevant industries were most trusted and closely watched by their peers online.</p>

<p>We helped that company find: </p>
<ul>
<li>the most important and relevant influencers they <em>already</em> had in their online audience</li>
<li>
the most important influencers they didn't yet have connections with and could engage with (with additional insight into which industry influencers their competitors were and weren't connected to yet as well)</li>
<li>
the news and conversations those trusted experts were discussing, sharing and most excited about, so that our customer could target those conversations for engaging in in order to grow their relationships with thought leaders in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result? Little Bird's technology and customer success team helped that company discover, vet and connect with <em>two times as many thought leaders as it had before we engaged</em> in just their first three months leveraging our platform.</p>
