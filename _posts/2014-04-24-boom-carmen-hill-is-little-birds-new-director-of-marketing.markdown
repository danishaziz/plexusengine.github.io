<p><em>Carmen Hill is the first of three incredible women who will be building our sales and marketing team starting next month! See also coverage at <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/24/social-discovery-engine-little-bird-snags-google-and-adobe-award-winning-marketer-carmen-hill/">Venturebeat</a> and the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2014/04/little-bird-taps-portlands-creative-community-for.html">Portland Business Journal</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/carmenmargin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2252" alt="carmenmargin" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/carmenmargin.jpg" width="300" align="right" /></a>When I wrote up a job posting for <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird's</a> new Director of Marketing position, I knew a lot of people were going to be interested. It's a pretty sweet gig, getting to lead the storytelling of a startup that's early enough in its growth to give you loads of creative control - but fortunate enough to have received great branding help from Weiden + Kennedy (thanks <a href="http://piepdx.org">PIE</a>!), nationally known investors, has scads of inbound interest every day, a really fun and powerful product, and more.</p>
<p>I <em>did not expect</em>, though, that one of our own customers, and one of the most respected content marketers in the world, would inquire. The internet is a big place but Carmen Hill has worked for the past few years in an office just a block and a half from ours here in downtown Portland.</p>
<p><strong>I am very excited to announce that Little Bird's marketing and sales enablement is about to get a very big boost when <a href="http://twitter.com/carmenhill">Carmen Hill</a> joins our leadership team next month as Director of Marketing!</strong></p>
<p>Carmen has won awards for her content strategy of projects she led for Google, Adobe, Jive and others while at agency Babcock and Jenkins. (She led content strategy on projects that won Content Marketing World Silver awards for Best Content Campaign, Best Landing Page and Highest Response Rate Generated.) Our own data shows (see below) that she's won the respect of many of the most influential people in the B2B marketing world. She's also humble, kind and a great person to be around. We're very honored to have Carmen join our growing team as we challenge early models of social network use for business and herald a new horizon of opportunity!</p>
<p>"Marshall and team have already built a solid foundation for growth, with enviable brand awareness and influential advocates," Carmen says. "Marketing today is about content, connections and conversations. Buyers decide when, where, how and whether to engage with brands. Their perceptions and purchase decisions are influenced more by trusted peers and social networks than on traditional marketing messages.</p>
<p>"That’s why Little Bird is such a valuable part of the modern marketing and sales toolkit. Unlike tools that rank influence based on vanity metrics such as total number of followers or retweets, Little Bird reveals meaningful relationships within specific communities of interest. It provides VIP access to the people and information that matter, and gives sales and marketing intelligence they can actually use. And I can’t imagine a more exciting opportunity than helping grow Little Bird to its next phase of awesome."</p>
<p><em>Below: Little Bird data shows that the heavy hitters know Carmen. That's an all-star list of earned connections. Hey Jason Falls and Brian Solis, you don't know what you're missing! Continue below for even more great news...</em><br />

<p><strong>And that's not all!</strong></p>
<p>As good fortune would have it, after our recent financing from the Oregon Angel Fund and subsequent addition of serious startup-power in the form of CTO Michael Jones and COO Ben Kaufman, Little Bird is now in its best position ever in the young life of the company to make big leaps forward with big hires.</p>
<p><strong>Carmen will be joined next month by two other super-smart women who have years of experience in enterprise sales. </strong>(Announcements forthcoming.) That's three incredible experienced women joining the team in one month. Carmen in marketing and our new sales organization are going to be a dream-team left-right punch and we are so excited about it!</p>
<p>What's next? We're hiring now for an <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2014/04/little-bird-seeks-interaction-designer-for-world-changing-technology-used-by-incredible-companies/">Interaction Designer</a> who's going to help level up the product and marketing materials, we're always looking for more great developers who want to build amazing systems to analyze social data.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out Little Bird yet, for yourself or for companies you work with, I would urge you to <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">do so now</a>. Because things are about to start moving real fast.</p>
