    Whoo! I love a good argument. I agree with you Marshall. However, getting any department, other than marketing, to use social media can be an uphill battle. Many think that it is too much work and too time consuming. But like climbing any mountain, one must start with one step at a time to reach the top.


    I've started this process with a bunch of sales peeps at Concur. They start small with the 10 minutes a day maintenance, get addicted to how easy it is to have direct interaction with prospects and then, they start really sprinting forward with social media — finally reaching the summit and landing deals all through social.


    Ok, enough of the analogies. Simply put, I agree with you, but we all have to start somewhere. Right?

  content: "Amy, for someone who likes arguing you're not very good at it - you're
    supposed to tell me I'm wrong! ;) \n\n\nEnough of the faux arguing - simply put,
    I can see your point too. Starting with 10 minutes a day sounds better than not
    starting at all.  \n\n\nWe here at Little Bird are focused on making sure that
    whatever time you invest is as focused on strategic opportunities as possible.
    \ When our customers onboard users, some of them engage with us entirely based
    on the lightweight emails we send each day.  There's a variety of ways to do it!\n\n\nThat
    said, they don't call an exponential curve an exponential curve for nothing -
    there's nothing quite like really digging in."

<p><em>Summary: If tasks can be Optimization (spend as little time as possible), Maintenance or Investment level tasks, based on their potential ROI, I'd argue engaging with content is best done as closer to Investment than Optimization level work.</em></p>
<p>Building relationships and engaging in online conversation is a daunting task when you're just getting started.  Should beginners find ways to spend very little time in order to get started? Maybe, but in the long run I'd argue that <em>content discovery and engagement is better treated as at least a 15 to 30 minute daily exercise rather than a 10 minutes per day exercise.</em></p>
<p>It's not that you get out of it what you put into it - you can get far more than that - with a minimum viable amount of time invested.</p>
<p><strong>Content engagement can have an exponential Return on Investment:</strong>  Especially if you're in a business where the average deal size is substantial, a single piece of content discovered and engaged with <em>well</em> can open up a whole vein of new business with big customers: it can ignite a new advocate or a new champion.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's cumulative.  Businesses are about relationships,  relationships grow over time, and the business value of being a known and trusted entity is exponential compared to cold calling - on or offline.</li>
<li>It's about connecting with other smart people. In B2B any one of those people could be a string that leads to a lot of business.</li>
<li>You know how they say luck comes to those who are prepared? <strong>Social business success also comes to those who show up and don't just phone it in.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I was prompted to argue with this "10 minutes a day" perspective because the very smart <a href="http://about.me/amywhiggins">Amy Higgins</a> of <a href="https://www.concur.com/">Concur</a> wrote a blog post on Heinz Marketing's blog today titled <a href="http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2014/08/hey-sales-heres-get-social-10-minutes-day">Hey Sales! Here’s How To Get Social in 10 Minutes a Day</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Sales people have always been social. They are connectors, navigators and above all, social by nature. Then, why is selling on social media so difficult for them?</p>
<p>When I asked our sales teams at <a href="https://www.concur.com/" target="_blank">Concur</a> this very question, they came back to me with answers like; “I don’t know where to begin”, “I don’t have time to devote to social media”, and my favorite, “I can’t see that it works.” To answer all of them and all of you reading this blog, let’s look into how to do social selling in less than 10 minutes a day and see results.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of Amy's advice in that post I agree with, but where I take issue with it is her suggestion that people spend just 10 minutes a day engaging with content online.  That's not enough time to do justice to the opportunity!</p>
<p><strong>FYI: Here at Little Bird, we've built a system</strong> that maps out a whole community of subject matter experts, then figures out which of them are most-trusted among their peers, then monitors those most-trusted to alert you when they find something worth sharing and that their community deems worthy of extensive re-sharing.</p>
<p>Here's what I said in a comment in response to Amy's post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amy, this is solid advice, especially for people who are just getting started. I would extend this advice by saying that content discovery, for curation, sales intelligence and more, is something I believe can be an investment level task - meaning a task with a potentially exponential pay-off. ... <em>it quickly becomes challenging to add meaningful value to a conversation if you're only giving 10 minutes to finding, thinking about and responding to other peoples' content.</em></p>
<p>I like to look at prioritization through a paradigm that says every task is either a. optimization (spend as little time as possible), b. maintenance (linear relationship between time invested and outcome, B+ level work is probably fine) or c. investment level (potentially exponential ROI, the more time you spend on these tasks, the more you'll get out of it) - I would argue that content discovery is most appropriately regarded as a maintenance or investment level task.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you think?</p>
