  content: The transactional end of the spectrum treats the product as a commodity
    rather than a strategic investment. With a strategic tool, you see a longer term
    yield for your effort rather than just a one time value bump. This means that
    if you compare a transactional product to a strategic product of the same price
    range, the strategic product actually has more net value when compared to time.

<p>There are a lot of technology options available to power your influencer marketing. Why? Because the power of the individual voice on the social web is growing increasingly well-known. Its power may be widely acknowledged, but that doesn't mean it's widely understood. Most people presume that the goal is to get influential people to talk about you or your brand, but there's so much more that can be done now.</p>
<p>How can we best understand the full range of technology options? We'd like to offer the following articulation of two ends of the spectrum: from transactional to strategic.</p>
<p><center><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Continuum.png"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Continuum.png" alt="Continuum" width="576" height="252" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3170" /></a></center></p>
<p><strong>Transactional</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generally limited to list-building, initial discovery and lightweight analytics.</li>
<li>May be pay-for-play, low-cost or free.</li>
<li>One-time advocacy is generally the goal.</li>
<li>"Influencers" may have a relationship with the platform.</li>
<li>"Influencers" are generally C or D list social media publishers with bulk-bin audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Strategic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery of influencers is just the first step.</li>
<li>Influencers are independent of the platformâ€”they generally do important work beyond social media and generally aren't "for sale" as transactional advocates.</li>
<li>May take the form of earned, owned or paid media.</li>
<li>If it's about earned media, work-flow requires investment of time and resources. May include consulting services or significant Customer Success support.</li>
<li>Advocacy is just the tip of the iceberg: T<em>he biggest forms of value</em> are early learning about industry trends, co-creation of the future, and the opportunity to build authentic relationships and meaningful thought leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Little Bird puts itself firmly on the strategic end of this spectrum.)</p>
<p>Taking a more strategic approach to relating to the most influential people in your market can prove helpful in a variety of ways. As Chris Musselwhite and Tammie Plouffe wrote on HBR a few years ago, but from a would-be influencer's perspective, "Influence becomes ineffective when individuals become so focused on the desired outcome that they fail to fully consider the situation. While the influencer may still gain the short-term desired outcome, he or she can do long-term damage to personal effectiveness and the organization, as it creates an atmosphere of distrust where people stop listening, and the potential for innovation or progress is diminished." (<a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2012/03/when-your-influence-is-ineffective/">When Your Influence is Ineffective</a>, HBR, 2012)</p>
<p>Engaging with influential people in serious topics from a transactional perspective runs the risk of landing both parties in that kind of situation. There's far more to be gained through considered, strategic engagement.</p>
<p>How does this view of transactional to strategic work with your understanding of the space? Are there other qualities you'd use to describe the two ends of this spectrum?</p>
