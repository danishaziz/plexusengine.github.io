excerpt: 'At Little Bird, we think prudent investors should include this kind of research
  to understand what kind of community and social connections exist around any planned
  investment: in a platform like Wordpress, in a specific market segment, in a company
  or brand, or in the founders or team of any business. From what Little Bird shows
  us about WordPress, clearly Tiger Global put money into something very real, with
  a global community, proven leaders, and a ten-year track record.'

<p>On this noteworthy day when we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of <a title="visit WordPress online" href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, Little Bird is of course pleased to be using WordPress to power our blog and website, as well as giving thanks to the broader Portland, OR WordPress community that fuels so many worthy local and global endeavors. We also bow to our fellow denizens at the <a title="Visit PIE online" href="http://www.piepdx.com/" target="_blank">Portland Incubator Experiment</a> from the WordPress commercial star, <a title="Visit Automattic online" href="http://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a>, which just saw $50M of their stock <a title="read about Tiger Global's investment in Automattic" href="http://toni.org/2013/05/24/tiger-invests-in-automattic/" target="_blank">purchased by Tiger Global</a> investment managers.</p>
<p>Why would a leading investment manager take such a sizable stake in a company tied to an open-source platform like WordPress? Reports made in just minutes with Little Bird discover the shape and size of the WordPress community and its vibrant ecosystem of <a title="visit WordCamp online" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp</a> events, now energized by another Portland luminary, <a title="read about Cami's job supporting WordCamp" href="http://camikaos.com/2013/04/17/hello-world/" target="_blank">Cami Kaos</a>, who just started as "Dotorg Admin" for Automattic, supporting WordCamps globally.</p>
<p>At Little Bird, we think prudent investors should include this kind of research to understand what kind of community and social connections exist around any planned investment: in a platform like Wordpress, in a specific market segment, in a company or brand, or in the founders or team of any business. From what Little Bird shows us about WordPress, clearly Tiger Global put money into something very real, with a global community, proven leaders, and a ten-year track record.</p>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wordpress.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-863" title="The Wordpress community discovered by Little Bird" alt="The Wordpress community discovered by Little Bird" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wordpress.png" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>On our first two runs, Little Bird identified 704 leading people and organizations in the WordPress community, interrelated by 26.3K social connections and led of course by WordPress founder <a title="find @photomatt on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/photomatt" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg</a>, but also including people like <a title="find @nacin on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/nacin" target="_blank">Andrew Nacin</a>, <a title="find @markjaquith on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/markjaquith" target="_blank">Mark Jaquith</a>, <a title="find @yoast on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/yoast" target="_blank">Joost de Valk</a>, <a title="find @bgardner on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/bgardner" target="_blank">Brian Gardner</a>, <a title="find @lorelleonwp on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/lorelleonwp" target="_blank">Lorelle VanFossen</a> and 698 (and counting) other leading WordPress (and Automattic) insiders.</p>
<p>Hot News that Little Bird is tracking on WordPress is naturally full of 10th Anniversary posts, but leading all other news is a link from WordPress insider <a title="find @chriscoyier on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/chriscoyier" target="_blank">Chris Coyier</a> to <a title="visit gifbrewery online" href="http://gifbrewery.com" target="_blank">GIF Brewery</a>, a handy utility that Chris tells us "lets you convert brief clips from your video files into GIFs." We can't wait to see the stream of animated GIFs celebrating WordPress's 10th anniversary and Automattic's continuing success!</p>
<h3>WordCamp</h3>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wordcamp.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-869" title="Wordcamp Community discovered by Little Bird" alt="Wordcamp Community discovered by Little Bird" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wordcamp.png" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>Also after two Little Bird discovery runs, we found 482 WordCamp insiders, interrelated by 13.5K social connections. Our WordCamp report includes some of the same global experts and influencers in our WordPress report, but also other leaders like <a title="find @jenmylo on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/jenmylo" target="_blank">Jen Mylo/Wells</a>, <a title="find @williamsba on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/williamsba" target="_blank">Brad Williams</a>, <a title="find @JJJ on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/JJJ" target="_blank">John James Jacoby</a>, <a title="find @LisaSabinWilson on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/LisaSabinWilson" target="_blank">Lisa Sabin-Wilson</a>, <a title="find @ryanimel on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/ryanimel" target="_blank">Ryan Imel</a>, as well as all the leading WordCamps worldwide. When people are spontaneously organizing events for something around the globe, you know you're on to something with some success.</p>
<p>Little Bird Hot News tells us WordCampers are celebrating the last 10 years of WordPress also, but they are already starting on the next 10 years: tomorrow, tickets go on sale for <a title="visit WordCamp SF online" href="http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp San Francisco</a> to be held 26-27 July, 2013.</p>
<h3>Make Investments with Your Eyes Open</h3>
<p>Whether you're ready to take a $50M stake in a company like Tiger Global did in Automattic, making smaller investments in any field, or just investing in yourself and your business, don't invest blindly! Discover and understand the communities of people and organizations already engaged in your targeted sectors. Who has influence and stature? What are leaders thinking and talking about?
