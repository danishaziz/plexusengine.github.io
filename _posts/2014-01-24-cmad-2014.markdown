    Thanks Shelby and team for putting together this list and post.  Little Bird is a happy participant in each year's Community Management Appreciation Day because community management is a great practice to help social networks and social business be fulfilling for everyone.  It's hard, messy, too-often-thankless work but it really benefits everyone.  The network is a cyborg! Made possible not just by computers but by human hustle and communication too!  Thank you Community Managers of the World!


    Special thanks to Little Bird's User Guide team @parakweets, @loveshelbyla and @burnstrong too!  You are all essential in helping Little Bird's customers big and small use the technology we're building to learn and do their business better.  We thank you for helping make it possible!

<p dir="ltr">Community Manager Appreciation Day (CMAD) 2014 is upon us! This year, in celebration of #CMAD2014 (yes, that’s the official hashtag!) <a href="http://mycmgr.com/">My Community Manager</a> has teamed up with <a href="https://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite</a> and a handful of <a href="http://communitymanagerappreciationday.com/meet-the-team/">other community-oriented companies</a> to celebrate the all-stars who keep our social networks running smoothly. They’ve collectively organized 24 hours of <a href="http://communitymanagerappreciationday.com/schedule/">live hangouts</a>, to begin on January 27, 2014 beginning at 00:00 EST (05:00 GMT). They’ll also be announcing 8 unique <a href="http://communitymanagerappreciationday.com/awards/">awards</a> to peer-nominated community managers across several different categories.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here at Little Bird, we think the inspiration behind CMAD is awesome! It’s all about practitioners celebrating their own—with results much like Little Bird finds by analyzing real human activities in context and the peer-to-peer relationships those activities build. For <a title="Meet the Top 1000 Community Managers on Twitter, Globally" href="http://getlittlebird.com/2013/01/meet-the-top-1000-community-managers-on-twitter-globally/">the second year in a row</a>, we decided to put our Little Bird discovery engine to good use for CMAD, to further uncover and recognize the most connected community managers of today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We used Little Bird to discover the widest possible online network of community managers, with the intention of sharing another lens through which we all can identify and celebrate this thriving community. We then trimmed our list to remove the companies and organizations, leaving just the humans who represent the top 100 community managers most followed by their peers. The result: 100 awesome people engaging communities on social media from all over the planet! We hope to see some insightful overlap between the community managers in this Little Bird report and CMAD’s nominees and award winners.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Little Bird’s influence ratings are based solely on the level of interconnection that topical insiders have with their peers, rather than an abstract measure of intrinsic value. These insiders are those who have built up sufficient peer recognition through their own personal engagement on social media with the other insiders in their community.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We also recognize that many community managers devote a lot of their online energies to brand accounts, and their personal identities might not always benefit from the same attention. To those who were not represented on our report: We encourage everyone to give some love to your own social presence online. With all that you have to teach us, we’d all love to hear from you personally, too!</p>
<p dir="ltr">There’s much knowledge to be gleaned from these savvy folks on the front lines of social media marketing and relationship management. Want to take in the CMAD community for yourself?
