<p>The future of content marketing is cloudy. That's one of the conclusions in a new report published this week by the Content Marketing Institute (CMI): <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/07/content-marketing-2014-state-of-enterprise/">The State of Enterprise Content Marketing: 2014</a>.</p>
<p>Many of us are excited about the awesome publishing power of social media and how it could help make marketing more genuinely useful, interesting and effective. But now there's trouble afoot — institutional, cultural and operational. Hopefully we can get through it, but it isn't going to be easy.</p>
<p>The CMI report is based on conversations among almost 40 leaders in the field from companies like 3M, Autodesk, IBM and more. The group was split evenly between West and East coast of the US. We turned the participants into <a href="https://twitter.com/marshallk/lists/content-marketing-experts" target="_blank">a Twitter list here</a> if you'd like to see who they are and engage with these leaders in the field over time.</p>
<p>You might think that the future is cloudy because (a) the web is now drowning in low-quality content, and (b) because it's hard to "feed the beast" with content worth the time of consumers (see Forrester's <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/laura_ramos/14-07-16-most_b2b_marketers_struggle_to_create_engaging_content" target="_blank">scathing post yesterday</a>) — but the smart people surveyed by CMI offer more detail than that.<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-2394"></a><br />
The 14-page document is a bullet pointed executive summary of those conversations; it took me about 30 minutes to read. I took notes as I did and thought I'd share some highlights with you. If you read about 400 words per minute, this blog post will take you less than 2 minutes to read. I heard you liked bullet points, so...</p>
<p><strong>Insights discussed in the report include:</strong></p>
<p>* Content marketing (hereafter CM) is often a multi-departmental effort, but generally grows bottom-up and has to prove itself in fits and starts.</p>
<p>* Some participants have seen success by explicitly avoiding an enterprise-wide approach.</p>
<p>* Budgets are now allocated, on average, in a 50/25/25 split among content creation, management and promotion. Promotion is essential to back up the resources invested in creation. "If you are going to invest in creating content, you MUST invest in promoting it as well," the report argues.</p>
<p>* CM typically requires education; corporate cultures that are unfamiliar with CM and are focused on control are a major challenge. It can be difficult to get employee buy-in, as more education is needed in all things related to social media. (It's in the Content Marketing Institute's interests to argue this, but it's also true in our experience.)</p>
<p>* A shortage of familiarity with data and measurement is a challenge faced by people interested in CM.</p>
<p>* The future of CM is cloudy. Consensus is that measurement, while essential for CM to survive as a strategic practice, is fundamentally broken and needs new ideas to measure success. (Does this mean attribution? We've got some ideas here, mostly about metrics around relationship building, but measurement is hard.)</p>
<p>* In the future, the Content Marketing Institute will explore a variety of new topics, including how companies can get better at the creation of content, not just managing it.</p>
<p>"Content will affect business," writes CMI's Robert Rose in <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/07/content-marketing-2014-state-of-enterprise/">his blog post about the report</a>. "It’s just a matter of 'how,' not 'if' — so enterprises must make a choice: Content can be managed as the strategic asset that it has (or can) become, or it can be an expensive by-product that ultimately weighs down a company as it tries to navigate the broader disruptions taking place."</p>
<p><strong><em>A word about the bird</em></strong></p>
<p>Here at <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>, we believe that one approach to improve your content marketing is to:</p>
<p>* Find something interesting to talk about.</p>
<p>* Find it and talk about it before other people do.</p>
<p>* Find those things to discuss by knowing who to listen to, and listening actively so that you can build meaningful relationships with smart people who will help distribute your content later, when it comes time to talk about yourself.</p>
<p>That's the approach we work with our customers to take and that we support with our software: expert source discovery, early news detection and more. We analyze connections to discover great content! Not just to "feed the beast" - but in support of strategic relationship building and business goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>Little Bird customers who use our software for content marketing do it like this:</em></strong> find credible sources, read their best content, engage with those sources and their content through either curation or inspiration, and thus grow credibility in their target markets.</p>
<p>We see the organizational challenges enterprise content marketers face as well, and our experience so far validates what CMI found in its excellent survey of leaders in the field.</p>
<p><strong>We're helping the future of content marketing grow less cloudy, or at least your experience in it, by helping companies create and curate great content in a competitive way.</strong></p>
