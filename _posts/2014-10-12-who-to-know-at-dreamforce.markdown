<p>Who are the super-connected people among the crowds at Dreamforce?  You might be standing right next to one and not even know it - until now.</p>

<p><img style="float:left; margin:0 15px 20px 0;" alt="Matt Heinz of Heinz Consulting" src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tst_mattheinz.png" width="100" /> Matt Heinz, one of the world's very top experts in marketing automation and social selling, likes to run Little Bird reports analyzing the online communities around all the events that he and his clients go to.</p>

<p>Dreamforce is no different, but this year we partnered with Matt to offer a personalized version of the sample Little Bird report you see below.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="#">Matt's post about the top 50 influencers at the event</a> - as measured by connection to their peers online.  These are the most-listened-to members of the Dreamforce community - by other members of the Dreamforce community.</p>
