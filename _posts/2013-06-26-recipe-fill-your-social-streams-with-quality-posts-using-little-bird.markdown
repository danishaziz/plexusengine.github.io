<blockquote><strong>Check out our weekly webinars and<a title="Webinar Registration" href="http://getlittlebird.com/tour/webinars/"> register now for an Intro to Little Bird!</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The secret to raising your stature, making valuable connections, and building business on Twitter (or any social network) is to consistently share ideas, news, connections and conversation that other people like and find valuable. If the people that like and value your posts have stature and credibility, then the attention they pay you will raise your own stature and credibility.</p>
<p>So how can you be interesting to people that matter in your field? It sounds like a lot of work, but you can use Little Bird to quickly and easily make better posts that will get attention from the right people by following simple daily practices.</p>
<h4>Your Experts</h4>
<p>Think of the insiders in a Little Bird report as your special team of experts who explore the world to bring you the most important and interesting news and connections they can find. Reshare and interact with the gold they bring you and engage them to build relationships with people that matter.</p>
<h3>Read &amp; Share the Latest Hot News Every Day</h3>
<p>Once you have a good Little Bird report, filled with people and organizations that have stature and expertise in your topic, bookmark the report’s Hot News page and visit it at least once a day. Browse Hot News to see what’s trending and what’s interesting and then do one or more of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Favorite</strong> a post that you find worthy. This sends a signal to the author that you are paying attention and giving them favor.</li>
<li><strong>Retweet</strong> a post that you think your audiences will enjoy. Just RT, or RT and Edit if you can add your own short comment that makes the conversation more interesting.</li>
<li><strong>Reply</strong> to the author of an interesting post with your appreciation or insight. The author will likely be pleased and your audience will see your engagement.</li>
<li><strong>Follow</strong> the author and/or retweeters of an interesting post to add their voices to your Twitter stream AND let them know that you are paying ongoing attention to them.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Find Golden Needles in the Internet Haystack</h3>
<p>Ready to talk about something more specific? Find out what the world’s leading experts have been writing about that subject and share and comment on their work. When you’re dealing with a specific issue that comes from breaking news or your client’s current business focus, where can you quickly find something worth reading—and sharing with your audiences? Use Little Bird’s Search to find relevant information, news, and posts about that more narrow issue from the websites and blogs of leading insiders in more general topic areas.</p>
<p>For example: Let’s say you are working on behalf of a nanotech company looking to increase its connection with consumer industries. Run a Little Bird report on “nanotech” and search the blogs and websites of leading nanotech insiders for a consumer industry keyword like “fashion”. In minutes you’ll find articles posted by leading nanotech insiders on subjects like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Google patent filing on fashion</li>
<li>self-cleaning clothes</li>
<li>designer nanocrystals</li>
<li>a nanotech scientist whose fashion inspiration is The Professor from Gilligan’s Island</li>
<li>3D holographic fashion shows</li>
<li>wearable electronics</li>
<li>Facebook “likes” appearing on in-store hangers to help crowdsource purchase recommendations</li>
</ul>
<p>In short order, you are a well-versed insider ready to share fascinating and timely posts on the intersection of fashion and nanotechnology. Or vice-versa: search for “nanotech” in a Little Bird report on fashion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SearchNanotechFashion.png"><img class=" wp-image-928 aligncenter" alt="Search Nanotech blogs for posts on Fashion" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/SearchNanotechFashion.png" width="600" /></a></p>
<h4>The pattern is simple:</h4>
<ol>
<li>When you’re focused on specifics, <strong>think of what more general topics might be an interesting intersection with your specific interest</strong>. Then run Little Bird reports on those more general topics.</li>
<li>Use Little Bird’s <strong>Search</strong> capability to search the blogs and websites of experts in those general topics for mentions of your more specific interest.</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> links to interesting content you find via search with your audiences on Twitter (or other social networks). If you can, include a mention of the content author’s Twitter username to also gain their attention and amplification of your post.</li>
<li>Bloggers love relevant comments. Get extra credit for adding your <strong>comment</strong> to an insider’s blog post so they can see, respond to, and reward your engagement.</li>
</ol>
