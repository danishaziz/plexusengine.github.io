    somehow it didn't make it into the article unfortunately.

<p>You've got something exciting to tell the world and you want to know who to talk to about it for maximum impact.  If that's part of your job, we can relate: Little Bird was built to help companies save time and discover new people to reach out to on the social web.  </p>
<p>You may spend hours, days or even weeks building a list of influential people in your target market—but does that mean the work is done? Nope. There are two steps we recommend taking that will make your influencer outreach efforts far more effective.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Welcome_to_Little_Bird_-4.jpg"><img src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Welcome_to_Little_Bird_-4.jpg" alt="Welcome_to_Little_Bird_-4" width="1183" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2901" /></a></p>
<p>Marketing thought leader <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fidelman">Mark Fidelman</a> is profiled in a blog post on Convince and Convert today titled <a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/influencing-the-influential-how-one-infographic-scored-17000-views/">Influencing the Influential: How One Infographic Scored 17,000 Views</a> in which he talks about finding the "Oprahs in every industry” and then reaching out to them. Mark says his team took 120 hours to research their list of influential photographers before a campaign. Mark's a smart guy, so some of those hours may have been super-charged by using Little Bird for influencer discovery. (Update: In comments below, Mark said, "We, as always, started with Little Bird." Nice.)</p>
<p>Mark didn't say how he found his list of influencers but he did describe some of his outreach steps in good detail and the post is worth reading. His effort resulted in an infographic about some of the top influencers in his client's target market, ongoing relationships with those influencers for the brand and 17,000 views (and counting).</p>
<p>Above, the front page of a dashboard for Photographers I just created, including using Mark's top influencers as seeds for our crawl.</p>
<p>Two steps we'd recommend adding to Mark's list, though, are these:</p>
<p><strong>1. Assess your current connections</strong></p>
<p>It's one thing to build a list of influential people—but wouldn't it be good to know which of them you've already got connections with? That's what we surface on the Discover Connections tab of every Little Bird report: not just who among your industry's leaders you're connected to, but who's connected to you and you haven't connected back with, who's been connected to you the longest and who's most recently begun paying attention to you. You can run that same analysis for your competitors and consider removing some people who may have had long-running relationships with them—or prioritizing thought leaders who've recently connected to other companies in your space.</p>
<p>Outreach from a known and trusted brand is far more effective than cold calling. That's why we recommend you not only figure out who you're known by among thought leaders in your field but also that you...</p>
<p><strong>2. Build those connections through conversation</strong></p>
<p>Whether you and your brand have just started on social or you've already got connections to hundreds of influential people in your target market, we guarantee there's room to grow those connections.</p>
<p>How do you do that? There's some low-hanging fruit in every community, people you can just reach out to who will follow you on Twitter or accept your LinkedIn invite—but the heavier the hitter, the more you're going to have to earn it.</p>
<p>How do you earn the attention of the most influential people in a field? By engaging with them around content, by adding value, by talking about what they care about—before you ask something of them. Literally, reply to their posts online, reshare them, comment on them, favorite them. Add as much value as you can, and they will turn their gaze to look at you.  When they do, this is what they'll ask: Is this a company or a person who looks interesting enough for me to pay attention to them in the future? Hopefully, you are. Finding and engaging with great content, early and often, is one way to be interesting enough for people to pay attention to you.</p>
<p>These tactics can help you build new connections and deepen existing connections. Then, when you reach out and ask for something that benefits you, you're asking as a Giver, not just a Taker.</p>
<p>It takes work to be a Giver. But as social marketing rock star hustler Gary Vaynerchuk said in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Bt-vEroq6M">Q&A video</a>, "Everybody's looking for quick tactics to make it easy, but putting in the work always, always, matters."  </p>
<p>The sooner you can get started, the better.</p>
