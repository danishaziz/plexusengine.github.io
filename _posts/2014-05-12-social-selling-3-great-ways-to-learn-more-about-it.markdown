  content: I love Jill's podcast on social selling. It seems like so many people who
    utilize online avenues like Twitter and FB forget about the humans on the other
    side of the screen. I was taught that we all want to buy...but not one person
    ever wants to be sold. I like Jim's show because it talks about collaboration
    tools. I'd be interested to know what you think of Mikogo as a social selling
    tool. You can use it to do secure online sales presentations. It has a whiteboard
    and can be recorded.

<p>Imagine a world where <em>sales people</em> compete to be the most useful, helpful, genuine and credible people online! That's the world we're moving towards, say advocates of the paradigm referred to as Social Sales. Sounds great to me. This is a big example of one of the ways that the social web is changing how business is done; in this case it's not about pushing out promotional content, or listening to what people are saying about you - it's about listening to learn and contribute meaningfully. Thanks to the structure of social networks, it's now possible to listen and contribute in a variety of strategic ways. You can do it with sheer effort, or you can use power tools, but either way - sales is changing.</p>
<p>The used car salesman is on his way out. The cold call is a thing of the past and Glengarry Glen Ross seems woefully shrill and out of date in an increasingly social world. Instead, always be...connecting, says social sales thought leader <a href="http://jillrowley.com">Jill Rowley</a>.</p>
<p>Many leading social business thinkers are practicing and sharing what they're learning about social sales.</p>
<p><strong>I've appreciated the following three resources about how to make your sales social, and I thought I'd share them here. I hope you and your organization finds them useful as well.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a> customers use our technology for social sales: to focus their time online on the most high-impact thought leaders, to discover content and conversations to engage with publicly, to add value to the network, and to increase their discoverability and credibility. Then they use our social graph data to better understand the people who come from the web to learn about what they're selling. It's a powerfully different way to do business.</p>
<p>If you're a Little Bird user, you can check out the Share and Engage page on a report about Social Selling to track the hottest conversations around the web about this movement, too.</p>

<h2>An introduction to Social Sales</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.salesforlife.com/">Sales For Life</a> is a 10-year-old organization that does social sales training. The video on their home page is a great introduction to the basic idea, in under 2 minutes! I've watched it several times and shared it with my team.</p>

<h2>In-depth with Jill Rowley</h2>
<p>Jill Rowley is one of the most influential thought leaders in the world of social selling and gives a great in-depth interview in <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/podcasts/2014/24906/social-selling-jill-rowley-marketing-smarts" target="_blank">this 30-minute podcast with MarketingProfs</a>.</p>

I knew it was important to add value but now I go out of my way to send as many valuable resources as possible during the sales cycle - instead of hoarding access to the product, I've been saying "this is the kind of value you can continue to access, indefinitely, if you become a customer. In the mean time, would you like some more?" People have been really responsive.</p>
<h2>One for the future</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JimClaussen">Jim Claussen</a> is a Social Business Strategy Leader and new media producer at IBM. He's been podcasting about using IBM collaboration tools for some time and has recently begun a new show called <a href="http://www.executivesocialacademy.com/fromsellingtoserving/">From Selling to Serving</a>. I enjoyed the first episode, which offered some good tips on using LinkedIn that I was not familiar with. The second episode is about LinkedIn as well and presumably has the same production value, usefulness and succinctness that characterizes the rest of Jim's podcasts. This is a good one to subscribe to; I have it in my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/from-selling-to-serving">SoundCloud</a> iPhone app.</p>
<p>I enjoyed Â those three resources and and find them really useful. I hope you do too. May the social selling movement make us all not only more effective - may it also help us become better contributors to the social web.</p>
