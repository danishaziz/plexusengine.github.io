  content: So great to catch up with you and Carmen. As one of the 75 or so people
    who have been to all 4 CMW shows, I can tell you it's one of my very favorite
    events every year. Good people, good content, good exhibitors, and exceptionally
    well-run. Hope to see you next year with Littlebird doing a big presentation!

  content: Great recap Marshall. This was my first Content Marketing World, although
    I have been a longtime part of the community, and big fans of Joe and Robert.
    It's a huge commitment to attend any conference as you mention, but CMW delivered
    for me. Both in the meaningful new connections I made, but also peeking behind
    the curtain at some enterprise content case studies. Speakers were especially
    generous with the details they shared, and the majority of the presentations were
    from end organizations. For anyone less familiar with CMI, I highly recommend
    their weekly podcast, This Old Marketing.

<p><a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CMWorld14_Web_1.jpg"><img src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CMWorld14_Web_1.jpg" alt="Print" width="261" height="110" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3059" /></a>The 2,500 attendee trade show called <a href="http://contentmarketingworld.com/">Content Marketing World</a> concluded tonight with a tornado warning and a fantastic keynote from Kevin Spacey. It (Spacey, that is) was full of smart, quotable, on-topic commentary and humor about the rapidly changing world of art, business and where they come together.</p>
<p>Business is a hustle though and the world is full of opportunities. Was it worth it to spend 5 days (with travel) in Cleveland, Ohio? This was my first trip to the event. I'd argue that it was worth it and here's why.</p>
<p><strong>Business</strong></p>
<p>As a company that sells <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">an enterprise social marketing and research solution</a>, Content Marketing World offered us <em>promising business opportunities</em>.  We got to meet with some current and some potential customers; from well-funded startups through savvy Fortune 500 companies. The trip resulted in far more pipeline than it cost in cash to attend.</p>
<p>Enterprise social software marketing often struggles with attribution of revenue but in this case, if some of these great conversations result in partnerships, then we'll have some hard ROI numbers to attribute.  Then we'll drive ROI with said partners and we'll all make a toast together next year in Cleveland.  That's the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Influencer relations</strong></p>
<p>The attendees of Content Marketing World included <em>many of the most influential people in the industry</em> and it was great to get to spend time with them face to face.  </p>
<p>Influencer discovery and engagement is what we do here at Little Bird, so before the event I ran a Little Bird report mapping 2000 of the most influential people in the world of content marketing. I personally saw 5 out of the top 10 of them standing within an arms length of me in the hallways, and they were friendly and accessible.  Any more detail than that would just be bragging, so I'll stop.  It was awesome though - and that face to face time is a great accelerator of online relationships. (Fill out a form to see a beautiful free sample report on <a href="http://getlittlebird.hs-sites.com/content-marketing-free-analysis">the influencers of Content Marketing World</a>.)</p>
<p><em>Photo: I only saw one of these three myself, but I'm glad they're able to make jokes about their mega internet fame before the social web implodes as a result of their proximity. Photo by <a href="http://www.twistimage.com/">Mitch Joel</a>.</em><br />
<a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Photo_by_mitchjoel.jpg"><img src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Photo_by_mitchjoel.jpg" alt="Photo_by_mitchjoel" width="613" height="612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3058" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Learning</strong></p>
<p>I came away from the first keynote of the event, by author <a href="http://www.akadrewdavis.com/">Andrew Davis</a>, so inspired that I ran back to my hotel room and created a whole new marketing deck of customer stories for my company.</p>
<p>And I concluded the event catching just the last 30 minutes of Kevin Spacey's keynote and struggling to write down all the awesome, inspiring, thoughtful things he said.</p>
<ul>
<li>"In a time of chaos, rules don't apply," said the public face of ground-breaking Netflix original content. "And it's those who make their own rules, those who give customers what they want, when and how they want it, will win."</li>
<li>"For people like you and me, there is no longer any excuse.  We just need to get a f'ing move on.  For people like us, there has never been a better time to create.  It's the risk takers who are rewarded."</li>
<li>"Authenticity has a lot to do with what's successful in content marketing.  Start with: what story do I want to tell?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots more from Spacey; I highly recommend seeing him speak if you get the opportunity.</p>
<p>Not every session I attended was great, but many were.  I missed a lot too, because it was a busy week for work outside of the conference. I especially appreciated though several sessions on the Wall St. Journal Expo Floor stage, including the panel on The Future of Content Marketing.  </p>
<p>Little Bird's Director of Marketing Carmen Hill is a serial CMWorld attendee and said she went to lots of great sessions.  The analytics intensive led by <a href="https://twitter.com/crestodina">Andy Crestodina</a> "paid for my entire trip" she Tweeted, and Deltek's Kristin Connell said <a href="https://twitter.com/kristinconnell/status/509722505687605248">she 100% agreed</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>
<p>Was the event fun?  I think a lot of other people had a lot of traditional fun.  I spent a lot of my time here in Cleveland having meetings, doing phone calls and getting ready to speak at Hubspot's conference <a href="http://www.inbound.com/">Inbound</a> next week in Boston.</p>
<p>But did I have fun?  Yeah - in my world (and I bet in yours!), making great business connections, face to face conversation with people who've built global influence by blazing new trails in their craft and learning a lot is my definition of fun.</p>
<p>I bet that meets your standards for fun, too.  So I think Content Marketing World was worth going to.  Did you go? Have you been in the past?  We'd love to hear about the ROI others experienced.</p>
