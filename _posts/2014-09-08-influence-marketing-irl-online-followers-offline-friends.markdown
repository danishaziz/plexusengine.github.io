<p><strong>Get ready to rock Content Marketing World with a <a title="CMWorld Influencer Report" href="http://hubs.ly/y07n8Y0" target="_blank">free Little Bird #CMWorld influencer report</a>.</strong></p>
<p><em>As I write this, it’s my birthday. I’m on a 6:20 am flight to Cleveland, drinking crap coffee with processed cheese spread and crackers for breakfast. Sound like a rip-off? Well, it would be, except I’m on my way to Content Marketing World—an over-the-top orange fun house for content nerds that I look forward to all year.</em></p>
<p>In just a few short years, Joe Pulizzi and his team at Content Marketing Institute have built #CMWorld into the content marketing event of the year, combining awesome speakers and content with cool venues and entertainment. Layer on a contagious obsession with the color orange, and you’ve got a devoted tribe that counts down days to #CMWorld like kids count days till Christmas. And it all starts now!<br />

<h3>Converting online connections into real-world relationships</h3>
<p>I always leave Cleveland with a ton of new knowledge. But, even more important, I leave with a lot of new and renewed friendships. For example, last year I finally met Jason Miller (LinkedIn Sr. Content Marketing Manager) in person after years of online conversations. He called out as I was walking through the hotel bar—and I recognized him immediately, at least partly because of his White Snake t-shirt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Jason-Miller3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3023" alt="Jason-Miller" src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Jason-Miller3.jpg" width="360" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>I also met Ian Cleary (Razor Social), Andy Crestodina (Orbit Media), Kyle Akerman and so many more people who are now my friends #IRL. The common denominator (besides a love of content) is that all of these valued relationships began online.</p>
<p><strong>Here are a few of the ways I’ve been staying in touch and getting ready for the biggest and best content marketing event of the year... and you can too!</strong></p>
<h4>1. #CMWorld Twitter chat</h4>
<p>Almost every Tuesday at 9 am Pacific, I tune into the #CMWorld Twitter chat. Hosted by the crack team at CMI, this chat features a real-time Q&amp;A with experts on a variety of content marketing topics. I not only learn a lot from the guest moderators, but also from all the other participants, who bring their own expertise to the #CMWorld party every week. It's also a hotbed of anticipation and meetup planning for the live event. That's why I’m really looking forward to finally meeting many of the regulars, <a href="http://twitter.com/lttlewys" target="_blank">Brandie McCallum</a>.</p>

<h4>2. Little Bird</h4>
<p>Our own tools are super useful for identifying and connecting with influencers at events.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Top Insiders:</strong> I used Little Bird to find and follow influential voices in content marketing—some of whom I already knew, but lots of others who fly a bit below the radar. I also see who I’m already connected to, people I’d love to be connected with who aren’t following me yet (sigh) and people who have followed me but I haven’t followed back yet.</li>
<li><strong>Share &amp; Engage:</strong> Find, follow and engage with the latest and greatest content that event Insiders are sharing.</li>
<li><strong>Daily Mission:</strong> I get an email every day on a report of my choice, highlighting hot content I might want to read and share, as well as an Insider who I am not yet following. Today I followed <a href="http://twitter.com/amyporterfield">Amy Porterfield</a>, who's #21 on our list of CMWorld Insiders.</li>
<li><strong>Lists/Export:</strong> Get a complete Insiders list in spreadsheet form or create a Twitter list. Our <a href="http://hubs.ly/y07n8Y0">free CMWorld Influence Report</a> includes a link to our Twitter of top 25o CMWorld influencers. Subscribe to the list (or create one of your own) and then set up a Twitter search stream filled with those people.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. List.ly</h4>
<p>In addition to Twitter lists, there's <a href="https://list.ly/~1cEEW">List.ly</a>. It lets you add yourself or others to the list. Are you on this CMWorld list that <a href="http://twitter.com/SFerika">Erika Heald</a> created? [listly id="QVV" layout="full" show_header="true" show_author="true" show_sharing="true" show_tools="true" per_page="25”]</p>
<h4><strong>4. Human touch</strong></h4>
<p>Once you've done a little research, set the stage for your face-to-face meetups. Nothing beats the human touch for influencer outreach. For example, Little Bird CEO <a href="http://twitter.com/marshallk">Marshall Kirkpatrick</a> and I (@carmenhill) are reaching out in advance to people we’d like to spend time with, so we don’t leave opportunities to chance.  Let us know if you'd like to connect at #CMWorld!</p>
