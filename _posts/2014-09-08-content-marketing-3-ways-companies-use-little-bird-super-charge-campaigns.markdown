<p>Here are three key ways that <a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/fly/">Little Bird</a> customers are using our influencer marketing platform for Content Marketing.</p>
<p><em>Quick take-aways:</em><br />
* A $10B multi-national corporation used Little Bird to grow its earned influencer relations online by 30-100% in two target markets in just 3 months prior to a big product launch.  Little Bird helps you discover, build and track your influencer relations for promotional purposes.<br />
* A marketing agency promoted its client's content with targeted social ads using Little Bird data and generated nearly 100% quality leads. 20% of Little Bird customers say they use Little Bird data to power social ad buys.<br />
* Curation and engagement with great 3rd party content enables brands to quickly grow their potential visibility by tens of thousands of relevant people online.  Little Bird surfaces the 0.05% hottest fresh content from top experts in any field, on demand, in seconds, after the initial creation of a topic report.</p>
<h2>I. Curation</h2>
<p><strong>Finding and sharing great 3rd party content</strong> with your own value-added editorial spin is a great way to build online relationships based on relevance.  And in a world where everyone's too busy to listen to you, as leading marketer and Little Bird investor Jay Baer puts it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KDALAi3guA" target="_blank">relevance magically creates time</a>.  <strong>In other words, if you're relevant enough to them - people will make time to listen to you.</strong></p>
<p>“When I was able to show how Little Bird pointed me to a thread I could comment on and the resulting pass-along put me in front of 80,000 potential readers with just a few minutes of thought required to compose what I wrote—that got people really excited about Little Bird.” - Karen Guglielmo, Content Marketing Manager at enterprise information services company <a href="http://ironmountain.com">Iron Mountain</a></p>
<p>Inside of every Little Bird report you'll find a page called Share and Engage.  On that page you'll find a stream of the latest content that the most influential people in your target market are sharing - but you've also got the option to limit that view to the hottest content.  <strong>Little Bird's expert and influencer filtering uses 5 layers of relevant social proof to display just the 0.05% hottest content from leaders in a topic.</strong>  That analysis is done on demand and takes just seconds once you've generated a big Little Bird report. </p>

For each topic that you run a report on, Little Bird gives you a filtered feed of the content being produced by the Insiders identified from that report. </p>
<p>"This alone might be worth the cost of the product, as the stream of content you see is not only a great way to engage the influencers, but feed your own content channels and curation efforts with regular, amazing content from those who know each topic best." -<a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/2013/11/7-ways-heinz-marketing-uses-little-bird-every-week/">7 ways Heinz Marketing uses Little Bird every week</a></p>
<h2>II. Inspiration, Co-Creation and Original Content Optimization</h2>
<p>When creating original content, it's important to understand your audience as clearly as possible.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jennlankford.jpeg" alt="jennlankford" width="250" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3016" /><a href="https://twitter.com/jenlankford">Jennifer Lankford</a>, Communications Director at developer-focused database-as-a-service company <a href="http://Orchestrate.io">Orchestrate</a>, says her company has leveraged Little Bird's social proof to pinpoint the best places to find inspiration for her own original content.</p>
<p>"Exploring the blogs and conversations on Twitter [that Little Bird discovers] gave us <strong>tons of ideas for topics that would be interesting to explore on our blog</strong>, for bylines, and for keeping up to date with the latest happenings in our market...Using Little Bird has certainly shown positive ROI. <strong>Members of micro-communities have a tendency to trust one another more than those outside of their community. It really works.</strong>"</p>
<p><strong>Co-creation:</strong> Little Bird's people-first technology helps map communities and content all over the world, too. Dubai-based online marketplace <a href="http://www.dubizzle.com/">Dubizzle</a> loves Little Bird's ability to discover influential people writing in Arabic - because it's about connections, not content, <strong>Little Bird is language agnostic and capable of working internationally.</strong></p>
<p>Dubizzle finds influential experts related to the Sharing Economy, a major focus for the company, to reach out to about co-creating original content.</p>
<h2>III. Promotion</h2>
<p>Creating great content isn't enough.  There's far more content being created these days than the market can consume - and yours is not going to promote itself.  Content creation is a part of a whole marketing value chain.  </p>
<p>Earned and paid promotion can both help seed your content with the most influential people in your market, helping your voice rise above the noise.</p>
<p><strong>Earned promotion</strong> comes in the form of building relationships with key influencers in your target market: Little Bird helps you identify and prioritize the ones you've got and build new relationships by engaging with top influencers around content of general interest.</p>
<p>One customer with a big product launch in the works (and a market cap over $10 billion) leveraged the Little Bird solution to <strong>grow its inbound influencer relations earned and catalogued in two target markets online by 30% and over 100%</strong> in just the first 3 months of using Little Bird.  </p>
<p>Those relationships are far more likely to result in effective promotion of the company's forthcoming announcements than cold outreach to unconnected influencers - and the relationship building has just begun.</p>
<p><strong>Paid promotion of content is another option.</strong>  Twenty percent of Little Bird customers who responded to a recent poll said they <a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/2013/04/recipe-create-a-targeted-twitter-advertising-campaign-using-little-bird/">use Little Bird data to target social ads</a>.  Most, like Orchestrate (above), combine paid and earned promotion together.</p>
<p>One social marketing agency reported that <strong>"nearly 100% of leads generated were quality"</strong> in a recent Little Bird-powered ad campaign for a mobile software client.</p>
<p>Those are a few of the ways that companies use Little Bird's influencer marketing technology to advance their Content Marketing goals.  We learn about new methods all the time, but most fall into the three general categories above.  </p>
<p>We hope you'll <a href="http://www.getlittlebird.com/fly/">get in touch</a> to learn about how Little Bird can help super-charge your company's content marketing today.</p>
