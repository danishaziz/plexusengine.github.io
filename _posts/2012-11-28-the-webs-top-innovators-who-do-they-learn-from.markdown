<p>If you're interested in the process and cutting edge of Innovation, who better to pay attention to than the leaders in the field? Ever since Clayton Christensen wrote <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Innovator_s_Dilemma.html?id=SIexi_qgq2gC">The Innovator's Dilemma</a> in 1997, his name has been synonymous with the study of Innovation. It turns out, though, that there are three other innovation specialists online who have the ear of more of their peers than Christensen does. (Only three though, that's pretty impressive!)</p>
<p>Who are those Innovation specialists most-watched by others in the field? Number one is Danish intraprenuership consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/lindegaard">Stefan Lindegaard</a>. On Twitter, which we believe is a good proxy for online social capital in general and where the data about who follows whom is accessible to us, Lindegaard is watched by top leaders in the field of Innovation like <a href="https://twitter.com/skap5">Saul Kaplan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenWalters">Helen Walters</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ariegoldshlager">Arie Goldshlager</a>. All those top leaders also follow Clayton Christensen, but Christensen has the ear of #2 on the list, <a href="https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida"> Richard Florida</a>, too. All of these Innovation specialists are at the top of our report on the topic because they're being followed by hundreds of other leading thinkers in the field.</p>
<p>Beyond individuals, though, the #1 voice in the Innovation community, according to the report I just ran on <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>, is an organization. Can you guess <a href="http://twitter.com/ideo">which one</a>?</p>
<p>If you want to connect with someone relatively new to social media but already hot among Innovation leaders, check out John Wolpert. He's been around startups, IBM and the Harvard Business Review for years, but he just started Tweeting at <a href="https://twitter.com/Innosanity">@Innosanity</a> this Spring. We found him in just a few minutes, as we did the top 500 other members of the Innovation community, by analyzing the connections between members of that community. That's what we do here at Little Bird: we map and graph those topical social connections and then give you tools for engaging with leaders in the field and their content.</p>
<p>Here are the top 20 individuals in the Innovation community online, as measured by connections inside of the big index of Innovation specialists that our technology created.  Our full report contains 500 people and organizations, and a whole pile of tools to engage with them.  Below, a screenshot of the hottest news today and this week among leaders in the field.</p>
