  content: 'Hey Marshall, I have been following your company and your blog.  I am
    wondering if this advice scales?  When everyone starts DMing every influencer
    in every category, the ''engagement machinery'' (Twitter in your example) is going
    to adapt to filter out spam/nuisances.  P.s.:  I really like LIttle Bird.'

  content: Bruce - sorry if this wasn't clear - the structural advantage of Twitter
    DMs is that you can only DM people who have opted-in to receive messages from
    you.  So I do think it will scale.  Thanks for your feedback!

  content: True.  However you can @ mention anyone, and that will be the default action
    by those looking to shortcut the process.  Engaging people, adding value, and
    establishing a relationship is often a messy and lengthy process (I am trying
    to solve this bit of the equation).  Cheers.

  content: "The process you describe is the heart of what I do to network. Been doing
    it for years. Better tools make it easier today. \n\nHowever, the learning from
    doing it ad hoc for the last seven years, along with Twitter magical limitation
    of 140 characters, has taught me how much better it is to actually engage. When
    someone is on my target list, I read their feed and look for ways to help them.
    Usually having nothing to do with selling more widgets. \n\nOn the other hand,
    when I ask a big influencer a thoughtful, on target questions (and not \"will
    you RT for me?\") most of them answer and most of them want to involved with my
    collaboration. \n\nLIttlebird is a good tool and will save me hours of work. Giving
    me more time to share some photos of my cat. :)"

<p>YouTube exec <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk">Hunter Walk</a> says (<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2013/01/13/im-back-what-have-i-been-up-to-what-next/">via</a> Mark Suster) that you should write blog posts not to show how smart you are, but to get feedback on your thoughts from other smart people - because that's a great way to learn.  How can you engage with smart people though?  Here's how you can do it using <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>.  Maybe you're already a Little Bird user, or maybe these strategies will inspire thoughts otherwise.</p>
<ol>
<li>Think of some keywords for your blog post or project.
<li>Run Little Bird reports on those keywords.   We'll find up to 500 of the most connected, peer-validated people online who specialize in that topic.
<li>Visit the Compare pages of those reports and find top people already in your community that you can Direct Message (DM) on Twitter.  If you aren't connected to any of the top experts in a topic, you should engage with them, add value and establish a relationship.
<li>DM them and ask if you can send them a draft of what you're working on.
<li>Incorporate any valuable feedback they send.
<li>Once you're done, DM people who did and didn't get back to you, closing the loop and sharing with them the finished product.  If it's good, some percentage of them will reshare that content with the big networks they've established and which Little Bird used to discover them.
<li>You can also use the Search function to find blog posts written by top experts in your field that contain certain keywords.  You can quote those blog posts to enrich your content and link to them to draw their influential attention to your content. You can also find their email address on their blog and email them asking for input on a draft.</ol>
<p><center><strong>Below: I could DM any of these experts on the topic of <em>Incubators</em> and ask for their input on a relevant blog post. They already follow me on Twitter.</strong></center><br />

<p>Ta da!  That's how Little Bird customers in media organizations, and I myself, have used Little Bird to add collaborative value and increased distribution to our blog posts.  Do these ideas inspire any other ideas in you?  Please share them here!</p>
