<p><em>Small business customer Orchestrate.io on how they use Little Bird and what they wish it did better.</em></p>
<p><img style="margin: 10px;" alt="" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/orchestratelogo.png" width="250px" height="280" align="right" /><a href="https://twitter.com/antonyfalco" target="_blank">Tony Falco</a> is an experienced entrepreneur and a very smart man. After graduating from the US Naval Academy, he became a VP at Akamai, then raised more than $20m at NoSQL company Basho and most recently founded <a href="http://Orchestrate.io">Orchestrate.io</a>, a startup that offers developers "all of the best databases orchestrated by a single, intuitive REST API."</p>
<p>That's a big shift for Falco and his team.</p>
<p>"We know all the leaders in the database community," he says, "but now we're building something that makes databases easier for people in the API community, the Javascript community, and other communities like that.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>"We need to learn who more of the leaders in those communities are, start building relationships with them and start creating high-quality content."</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the ways this little startup is using its Small Business subscription to Little Bird to jump start the building of its connections and knowledge of new markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>They run Little Bird reports on various target markets, then go connect on Twitter, LinkedIn and elsewhere with the leaders in those markets. They click on the links in their <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/2013/07/announcing-the-giant-summer-feature-release-at-little-bird/"><strong>Daily Mission emails</strong></a> from Little Bird and quickly make new connections.</li>
<li>They've bookmarked the <strong>Share and Engage pages</strong> for those reports and watch for interesting new developments in their new target markets. When opportunities arise, they talk about those news stories on their Twitter account and blog.</li>
<li>They look at the <strong>list of top blogs</strong> that comes with every Little Bird report, they visit those blogs and see what kinds of topics leaders in their field are talking about. They take note how those topics are discussed too, so they can talk about them in a way that's consistent with how others do. That's a pretty awesome use case, we haven't heard about anyone else doing this yet.</li>
<li>When they're looking at attending or sponsoring a conference, they run a Little Bird report on that conference to see what the community around it looks like. They use the <strong>Discover Connections tool</strong> to see who they are already connected to around the event. That information helps them make decisions with their precious conference budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have to be as smart as Tony and the Orchestrate.io team to jump over the learning curve like this, anyone with a Little Bird subscription can grow their company's social capital using these easy, but effective practices, without investing lots of time.</p>
<h3>What Tony Wishes Was Different</h3>
<p>It's hard to believe that any customer doesn't have some issues with anything they pay for, and sure enough there are a few things Orchestrate wishes was different about Little Bird. I asked.</p>
<p>Tony says he wishes that the Top Blogs section was a little more closely curated, too often he finds off-topic blogs there. To be frank, that's not something we're likely to prioritize in the short term.</p>
<p><strong>He also says he wishes the data came with more instructions about how to use it.</strong> <em>That is something we hear loud and clear and will be offering more of ASAP. </em>We hope that Tony's story about how his company uses Little Bird will be helpful to some of our other customers, and other customers' stories will be helpful to Tony. Watch this space for what we've been calling "recipes" - quick and easy ways to make use of the information that Little Bird discovers for you.</p>
<p>Thanks Tony and team, and good luck! We're thrilled that we can help your company expand its market of customers!</p>
