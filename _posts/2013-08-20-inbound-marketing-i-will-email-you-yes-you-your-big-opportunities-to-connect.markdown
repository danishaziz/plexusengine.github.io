<p>How would you like to discover some great new people to know, some of which may already know about you? I'd like to email you, personally, some names of people you haven't connected with yet but who you should.</p>
<p>Those kinds of opportunities are one of the things that Little Bird helps you discover about any industry - but I want to surface them for you about one topic: inbound marketing.</p>
<p>If you visit this form, enter your Twitter handle and email (<strong>Update:</strong> Ok, that was great but we gotta cut folks off! Really glad people were excited about this, we (and I mean the awesome Darby Burn Strong and I - and mostly Darby) sent a lot of emails out, but if you'd like this kind of information - you should sign up for <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">Little Bird</a>!) I'll plug you into our Little Bird report on inbound marketing and I'll personally email you a list of your top opportunities to connect with leaders in the field. I'll also make sure you're in line to get a trial account with Little Bird, which will let you run reports and get access to tools to connect with the leaders in whatever industry you work in.</p>
<p>Maybe you work in CPG, or health care or you sell boating supplies. Whatever the topic, Little Bird is all about discovering new opportunities to connect and do business on the social web. The lens we use to discover those opportunities is trust, expertise and influence.</p>
<p><center>Below: @marshallk's biggest Missed Opportunities, top peer-validated inbound marketing experts following me on Twitter whom I'm not yet following back. Tell me your twitter handle and email and I'll send you this list for yourself or your company.</center>&nbsp;</p>
<p><center><img alt="" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/marshallsmissedinbound.png" /></center>I'm attending the big <a href="http://inbound.com">Inbound</a> marketing conference in Boston today and Seth Godin's keynote about helping people connect brought this idea to mind. We help people and companies discover each other and connect as part of our core functionality, but since marketers are a key constituency of ours and thousands of you are watching the Inbound conference, this makes sense. I hope you find this useful and inspiring!</p>
<p><strong>Below: Here's the very very top of our report on Inbound Marketing. How do we do it? By analyzing the connections between specialists, we find out who's the most connected node in the network! That's a great place to start.</strong><br />
