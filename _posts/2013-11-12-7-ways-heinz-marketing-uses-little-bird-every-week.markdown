<h3>How Matt Heinz Uses Little Bird</h3>
<p>Months after I first started using Little Bird, my man-crush continues. Little Bird is still one of the top three social marketing tools I use on a regular basis, and I'm surprised when I occasionally hear people question the value of this tool, especially after reviewing an initial set of reports. I use Little Bird on a weekly basis. Here's how I use it, and why.</p>
<h4>New Reports</h4>
<p>I create new reports on a weekly basis. Yes, there are the fundamental reports I built in the first couple days, but there are new topics I regularly explore to discover additional influencers. I choose these report topics based on a number of inputs; campaigns other marketing vendors are running, new buzzwords that are emerging or becoming prominent, real-time events and hot topics in the news, etc. Reviewing various reports around similar topics will provide plenty of overlap between lists, but it's really valuable to know which influencers are higher ranked for particular topics. It's a great way to engage them and get their response on a topic they are particularly passionate about.</p>
<h4>Update Reports</h4>
<p>Say you ran a report on Social Selling six months ago, for example. It's highly likely that the list of influencers from that report has changed significantly since creating that report. People move up, people move down, new influencers join the list. For the topics you care about most, especially those topics that are really relevant in the social sphere now, the lists of influencers can change often. The more you're up to speed on those changes, the more likely you're reaching and influencing the influencers themselves. (Note that there ARE dynamic parts of a report on Little Bird, like the Share &amp; Engage feature, which updates the Hot News of a given report in real time, highlighted below!)</p>

<h4>Events &amp; Conferences</h4>
<p>I can't tell you how often I've run a report for a specific conference (for ourselves or one of our clients) a few weeks in advance, and then used that list to generate significant pre-show buzz, news coverage, at-show meetings, etc. Then, after the show, I run the report again to see how the list has changed based on who was particularly active and/or influential at the show itself.  This is a great way to surround and build value with the event's related influencers, and significantly increase your event ROI with little added cost (in the form of human capital).</p>
<h4>Using Hashtags on Twitter to Inform Your Reports</h4>
<p>Paying attention to trending hashtags makes for a good source to leverage on a regular basis. Some hashtags are tied to events, but others emerge as themes or memes in a particular industry. For example, Lattice Engines recently launched a highly-effective campaign focused on celebrating "Marketing Nerds," those who thrive on analytics and data to increase marketing performance. As part of the campaign, they launched and saw a ton of activity using the #mktgnerd hashtag. You can use tools such as Tweepi to get a roster of those participating in the hashtag, but if you want a (socially) ranked list of the most important and influential people using #mktgnerd, use Little Bird.</p>
<h4>Engage with Influencers NOT Following You</h4>
<p>One of my favorite features in Little Bird (and there are many) is the ability to view the list of Insiders through different lenses. One lens in particular shows you who among that report is following you, and another lens that easily shows you who is NOT following you. This insight is easily gained by using the Discover Connections tool within every report. You can not only discover who is and who is NOT following you, but you can use any Twitter handle to see how your various brands and others are connected to a particular online community. As a brand, you'll likely want to engage all of the top Insiders on a report, but you'll want to apply extra attention to those not yet following you (in which case you might not even be on their radar).  Also, if someone at your company is themselves an influencer for a particular category, engaging more of the Insiders not following you will increase your own "insider score" and rankings on the list.</p>
<h4>Aggregated Content Feeds</h4>
<p>One of the best ways to get an influencer's attention is to promote their content. For each topic that you run a report on, Little Bird gives you a filtered feed of the content being produced by the Insiders identified from that report.  <strong><em>This alone might be worth the cost of the product</em></strong>, as the stream of content you see is not only a great way to engage the influencers, but feed your own content channels and curation efforts with regular, amazing content from those who know each topic best.</p>
<h4>What Are Experts Saying About a Topic (or, Little Bird as a search engine)</h4>
<p>I also use Little Bird as a search engine specifically filtered for the most important influencers on a topic.  Within a particular subject area, you can enter a keyword or phrase and get results specifically based on what that subject's influencers have said or published previously.  This is hugely valuable for accelerating your own "competitive intelligence," finding new content for curation, being a source of valuable information by answering questions for your own customers, and more.</p>
