    Marshall - a community manager is... ?

    I opened the Big Report and scrolled all the way down. Was looking for a line about what a community manager is. I would have a hard time distinguishing CM from folks in very closely related functions, and trouble labeling those who have that hat along with others.

    p.s. Seeking an experienced SMM pro for client-facing role on several accounts.

  content: Hi Rebekah, sorry for the delay in responding.  That would have been a
    good thing for us to include here, but we also don't want to assert a particular
    definition ourselves.  The way Little Bird works is that we start with a keyword
    and some example Twitter accounts, then we spider out across all the connected
    accounts to build up a topical community.  Then we see who's most peer-connected
    in that community.  We can do that with Community Managers, but we also do it
    with any other topic - that could be B2B marketing, it could be genetics, Italian
    food, water conservation, whatever the case may be.  So ultimately, the definition
    of Community Management isn't up to us here at Little Bird - we just map the communities
    online around the concept and leave the definitions up to the practitioners!

  content: Douglas, turns out the current iteration of our technology stopped indexing
    before it found you, but if it had, you would have had an "Insider Score" of 68,
    meaning that 68 of the top CMs we indexed are following you.  That puts you in
    the 190th row in the spreadsheet of top 500 that I'm looking at.  Sorry we didn't
    catch you, right now our spider crawls the social graph until it hits several
    thousand people it discovered, then stops.  For most topics that's enough.  We're
    implementing a new system that won't stop though, and will find you :)  I could
    also have added you at the beginning, in order to make sure you were included.

  content: Everson, I'm afraid only 31 of the top CMs we indexed are following you,
    which is not a high enough number to get into the top 500 :(  Get 5 more to follow
    you and you're in, though!  *You* however, are a CM following machine, man!  I
    see you're following 465 of the top CMs yourself - which is more than all but
    3 of the people on our top 500 list is following in return!  I bet you see everything
    that goes on there!  Your mission, if you choose to accept it, will now be to
    rock the worlds of more of those community leaders you've already identified.  Little
    Bird could help!  Good luck and thanks for stopping by!

<p><strong>Little Bird found the Community Managers that are most-watched by their peers, other Community Managers.</strong></p>
<p>Today is the 4th annual observance of a fun event called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Manager_Appreciation_Day">Community Manager Appreciation Day</a> (#CMAD). Those hard working, public-facing, anger-catching, remedial-question answering, opportunity illuminating angels from heaven deserve their own day!</p>
<p>As we transition from a cold, impersonal, mass-production, one-way-broadcast industrial economy into a world where sales people give you more information not less, where everyone has an important public voice and where empathy is increasingly understood as a social and business imperative, not a form of insanity - the world needs more great Community Managers!</p>
<p>Here at Little Bird, our technology maps out any online community (today on Twitter and blogs, tomorrow - the world!), figures out who the members of those communities are most paying attention to, then provides tools for engaging with those people and their content. We ran a couple of Little Bird reports on Community Managers due to the occasion and CMAD founder Jeremiah Owyang graciously included some stats and analysis from our reports <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2013/01/28/10-key-stats-of-the-community-manager-space-cmad/">in his annual blog post about the day</a>! It's a good post and Jeremiah is a great source on this and many other cutting edge social media and business matters.</p>
<p>We don't want to reproduce what Jeremiah posted on his blog, so we thought we'd just introduce the top 500 Community Managers globally and the top 500 in Europe here in this post using Twitter's List Embed function.  (Here's <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/communitymanagersbigreport.jpg" target="_blank">a snapshot of our big report</a>, though!)</p>
<p><center><a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/getLittleBird/top-500-communitymanagers" data-widget-id="296078024342896640">Tweets from @getLittleBird/top-500-communitymanagers</a><br />
<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script><br />
</center></p>
<p>WordPress doesn't want to let me show two widgets on one page, so <a href="https://twitter.com/getLittleBird/top500commntymngrs-europe">here's the list for top 500 Community Managers in Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a rough map of where the people in the Global set are located.<br />
<img src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/TopCMLocations2.jpg" width="550px"></p>
<p>Here's a few additional and fun details:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are these lists built? Little Bird spiders out to find the network of social connections among thousands of community managers. Then we calculate which community managers command the most attention from their network peers. Finally, we sort the network and return the top 500 validated by their fellow community managers.</li>
<li>How did we put them all in these Twitter lists? That's one of the Export options that Little Bird business subscribers get with their subscription. Discovering, vetting and putting all these people into lists took about 10 minutes. Thinking about how to engage with them, what content to create based on this influencer discovery, that took several hours. Wouldn't you rather spend your time doing high-value creative work, instead of clicking a bunch of links? Let our robots click the links for you!</li>
<li>What else can Little Bird do? Imagine doing this analysis about your target market or community. Whether that's Action Sports, youth nutrition, aeronautics or wine - <strong>if there's a connected community on Twitter and blogs about your topic of interest - Little Bird can find it, map it, rank it, let you search inside it, see its hottest news each day and more.</strong></li>
<li>What's your relationship with all these community managers? If you're already a Little Bird user, you can visit the Compare pages here <a href="http://beta.getlittlebird.com/marshall/report/2038/compare">US</a> or here <a href="https://beta.getlittlebird.com/marshall/report/1757/compare">Europe</a> and learn about your existing connections and your next opportunities to roll with the big dogs in this particular community. No Little Bird account? You can sign up to request access to one in the next days or weeks <a href="http://getlittlebird.com">here</a>.</li>
<li>Want a well-written, short introduction to the finer points of community marketing? One of the hottest links among top community managers today (detecting that is something else we do) was this great Slideshare from Microsoft/Yammer's Maria Ogneva, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Yammer/community-management-playbook">The Community Management Playbook</a>.</li>
</ul>
