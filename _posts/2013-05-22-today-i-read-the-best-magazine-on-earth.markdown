  content: 'What''s the point of telling everybody how wonderful this is if no-one
    can actually use it? I signed up months ago and still no access, and to be frank
    I''ve forgotten what all the fuss was about. Therein lies a marketing lesson:
    Don''t go bragging too much until you can actually deliver.'

    Really good post, Nate.  I did exactly this myself just last weekend, filling up Feedly with great sources on Learning, Management, VC and Art.  My Little Bird reports on Learning and Professional Development were particularly valuable.   I came across a man named Scot Young whom I hadn't heard about before and found this fabulous resource called The Feynman Technique for Learning Anything.  Hot damn has it opened my eyes to a whole new world of learning and business super powers.   Here's his broader discussion on the topic http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/05/10/learn-anything-in-less-time/


    I've now been opening up my Feedly app whenever I get a chance because I know there's going to be nothing but great content in there, which I found thanks to Little BIrd's great source discovery capabilities.   Thanks for spelling it out here!

    I probably wasn't clear enough about which tools are doing which part of building and publishing these magazines Dave.


    Little Bird discovers the content (feeds) and another tool, Feedly, brings that content together in a reading experience. It's probably fair to say that Feedly is competing with Flipboard.

    Thanks Marshall! That looks like a very interesting read...I'll have to plan an obsessive mission to read it all. For starters, I saved it to read later in Feedly using their handy "mini toolbar" web bookmarking plugin, which is a bit hard to find.


    Go to to your preferences in Feedly and scroll down to the "Mini Toolbar" area to enable the toolbar on webpages you are browsing.

  content: Sounds to me like the mash-up is competing more with Percolate and Publish
    This. An interesting and helpful application, but I still think the best use of
    Little Bird is to engage influencers as authors for your content.

    Marshall:  I tried Little Bird when it opened in beta and it was quite good, but I have one serious issue: When dealing with non-english sources (spanish in this case) the quality of the results degraded substantially and couldn't really get as much value from it. ¿Is there any chance this will improve in the future? ¿Was it something that was fixed later and I just didn't happen to see it? ¿Is it a feature, not a bug? ;)

    I'd love to show this to PR and advertising agencies here as they would find it an invaluable tool. But although the concept is bulletproof in operation under real-world conditions it is not as good a solution for us in a non-english environment.

    Update on Feedly: Now that Google Reader is officially retired, Feedly has implemented an OPML import capability, which makes it easy to export the awesome topical insider blog feeds Little Bird discovers and bring them in to Feedly to produce a daily, best magazine on Earth on any subject.

<h3>And so can you, on any topic</h3>
<p>A great magazine is a fantastic pleasure and wonderful resource. A really great magazine that delivers a consistent intellectual and sensory experience over time is usually a phenomenal collaboration, requiring the coordinated efforts of a large team of people, working together to bring you their shared vision.</p>
<p>While I honor flagship magazines that have delivered unique experiences: National Geographic, Vogue, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Wired, Interview, Low Rider, Highlights, etc—with Little Bird, I can now create—in minutes—an experience that rivals, and in some ways, far surpasses, these greats.</p>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cheese.png"><img class="wp-image-850 aligncenter" alt="cheese" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cheese.png" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>First, I use <a href="http://getlittlebird.com/" title="visit Little Bird online">Little Bird</a> to identify the leading conversants worldwide in any topic: opera, health technologies, street art, open data, social CRM, cheese, globalization—or whatever. These insiders become my stable of authors, publishing high-quality, relevant and smart works on any topic of my choice, and so often that I have a fresh, unread issue of a topical magazine at my side every day, ready for my attention. Little Bird is my editor—my Helen Gurley Brown—making sure I read only the very best.</p>
<p>Then, I bring all the expert content Little Bird discovers into <a title="visit Feedly online" href="http://www.feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a>, which magically transforms the raw content streams of these global experts into a sensual reading experience on my computer—or even better on my phone or tablet—that rivals a fine magazine, automatically and daily. It's like a new world-class magazine hits my porch every morning, filled with fresh ideas, images, sounds, and insights from my own personal correspondents spread around the world, selected to make sure I only see the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/opera.png"><img class="wp-image-851 aligncenter" alt="opera" src="http://getlittlebird.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/opera.png" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>For business and for pleasure, I now know I have material worth my attention that can challenge—or change—my thinking, waiting for any free moment I might have. When I'm ready, the casual flip of my wrist brings me early signals and deeper insights that expand my thoughts, clue me in to what I might've missed, and keep my own expertise informed.</p>
<p>You may think it sounds like too much, while I wonder why you'd want to bother with anything less. Meanwhile, there's a new open data stream on cheese opera I need to visit...</p>
