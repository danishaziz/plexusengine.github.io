<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px;">We want to make sure you know what we're talking about when we use the following terms! Let us know if you have questions (email us at </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="mailto:help@getlittlebird.com">help@getlittlebird.com</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">).</span></p>

<h3 dir="ltr">SaaS (Software as a Service)</h3>
<p dir="ltr">SaaS is a type of software delivery, in which the software components and all associated data is hosted in the cloud, and made available to users via the web. Being cloud-based, there is no need for the user to install any software on his or her computer, and system maintenance is taken care of by the SaaS provider. Little Bird is an example of a SaaS platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Topical Community / Network</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We use the terms ‘topical community’ and ‘network’ interchangeably, and they’re used to describe a group of people who are gathering together around a specific topic online, via social media platforms (like Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc…).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Sub-community</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Sub-communities are smaller communities within the larger topical community; made up of members who are more tightly connected to one another (clustered), than to the topical community as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Insider Score</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Insider Score is the number that is associated with each report Insider. This number is calculated based on the number of other people within that topical community, who are following that particular Insider. For example, if a person has an Insider score of 458, it means that 458 other Insiders are following that person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Insider / Influencer</h3>
<p dir="ltr">An Insider is a person who appears on a Little Bird topical report, as a member of a given topical community. This person is contextually influential within the topical online community that they are part of, and his or her influence also most likely extends beyond the web and into the industry that they participate in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Report</h3>
<p dir="ltr">A report is an organized collection of information related to a topical online community. It includes the list of influential people within a given community, as well as tools to assist in your engagement with them and metrics to gauge your progress with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Reports Dashboard</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The reports dashboard is like an e-briefcase; it’s the place that all your reports live within the Little Bird application. On your dashboard, you’ll find a list of all the reports you and others in your organization have made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Account</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Account refers to a single user seat within an organization. Each user has a unique account which is tied to their full name, email address, and an authenticated Twitter account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Organization</h3>
<p dir="ltr">An organization is a group of users who are part of the same subscription plan. In most cases, the users within an organization are colleagues / part of the same company, and are using Little Bird in a collaborative way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Subscription</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There are a number of different subscription levels that a customer can choose, based on the size of his or her business and needs. If you’ve decided to become a subscriber and would like to chat with us about finding a good fit, please reach out to <a href="mailto:help@getlittlebird.com">help@getlittlebird.com</a>. We are happy to help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Admin / User / Viewer</h3>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Admin (Has control over the organization) - Admin-level accounts can create their own reports and view/delete the reports that others in their organization have created, can alter the status of a subscription, invite other users (and set their permissions), and can view payment history and change billing information.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">User - User-level accounts have the ability to view any of the reports that have been created by members of their organization, and can create reports of his or her own.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Viewer - Only has the ability to view reports that have been created by others in their organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Follow / Follower</h3>
