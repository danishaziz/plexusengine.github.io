<p>If you’re opted-in, you’ll receive a Daily Mission email for one report, once a day, on a selected topical report of your choice. These emails contain two parts: First, a suggestion for you to follow one (1) report insider who you’ve yet to follow, and second, three (3) hot news stories from the Share &amp; Engage feature that have been shared by Insiders from your selected topical report. You can opt in or out of these emails by adjusting your email preferences under ‘Settings’ (found in the drop-down menu beneath your name in the upper right-hand corner of the Little Bird window), or directly from the body of your Daily Mission email.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Select a Daily Mission Email Report</span></h3>
<p>To select which of your reports you’d like to receive a Daily Mission Email about, navigate to your Reports Dashboard page and hover over one of your reports. When you hover over it, a drop-down options bar will appear and you’ll see a circle with ‘Daily Email’ next to it. Clicking inside that circle will set that particular report as your Daily Mission Email report. In the future, we hope to allow for more than one Daily Mission Email, so that our customers may elect to receive emails about more than one topical report.</p>
